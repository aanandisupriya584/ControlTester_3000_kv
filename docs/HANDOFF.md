## 2026-06-24 Update - Apex Bug Fix Pass

- Stashed the pre-fix working tree as `stash@{0}: pre-apex-bug-fixes-backup` before starting page-by-page edits.
- Fixed landing page directory tiles so module sections are expanded by default.
- Updated Settings/API key handling so Gemini key status is selected by default and `GEMINI_API_KEY` is accepted as a Gemini env alias alongside `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.
- Made Risk Assessment suggested-control application idempotent in both UI and API, preventing repeated refresh/click actions from applying the same risk/control pair multiple times.
- Added the questionnaire NA rationale field so selecting `NA` opens a description box only for that specific question and stores it in that answer's details.
- Fixed Control Testing shell scrolling and queued evidence-file layout so files remain visible above action buttons.
- Fixed SOP Uplift shell scrolling, upload toolbar responsiveness, duplicate extraction loading indicator, and crowded document dialog close action.
- Verification: `node client/src/pages/landing.layout.test.ts` passed; `node client/src/control-testing.scroll-shell.test.ts` passed; `cd kpmg_ui && npm run check` passed. Backend pytest could not run because neither `python` nor `py` is available in this shell.

---

## 2026-06-23 Update - Risk Assessment Questionnaire Draft Save

- Fixed the Risk Assessment questionnaire Save Progress action so partially answered questionnaires are persisted immediately instead of only showing a local toast.
- Added a `save_as_draft` option to the `/risk-assessment/{ra_id}/respond-batch` API so Save Progress keeps the assessment status as `draft`, while Continue still submits completed questionnaire responses as `in_progress`.
- Added focused backend coverage for draft batch saves and kept the existing Continue behavior intact.
- Verification: `cd kpmg_ui && npm run check` passed. Host Python was unavailable and the FastAPI container does not include pytest, so backend pytest could not be executed in this environment.

---

## 2026-05-13 Update - Control Testing V2 Foundation

- Scope: implemented CT V2 Plan 1 foundation for the new `/ct` FastAPI surface while preserving the existing legacy Control Testing UI and `/audit/*` paths.
- Added Redis AOF persistence in `docker-compose.yml` so future queued CT worker jobs have durable broker state during local restarts.
- Added `utils/control_assurance/` with CT Pydantic request models, MongoDB index setup for `ct_sessions`, `ct_controls`, and `ct_issues`, and GridFS helpers for the `ct_files` bucket.
- Added and registered `api/routers/ct_v2.py` with session CRUD/status, manual control input, population upload, multi-file evidence upload, evidence delete, workbook streaming, and blank CT input template download.
- Added `api/templates/CT_Input_Template.xlsx` with `Control Data` and `Instructions` sheets for manual CT input. This is separate from generated SOX workpaper output.
- Added `api/tests/` coverage for CT models, GridFS helpers, and the `/ct` router; `api/tests/conftest.py` ensures the planned `cd api && python -m pytest tests/ -v` command can import repo-level `utils`.
- Verification: `docker compose up --build -d fastapi_api web_ui_agent` rebuilt and started healthy API/UI containers; direct `http://localhost:8000/ct/sessions` and BFF `http://localhost:5000/api/ct/sessions` both returned `[]`; BFF smoke created a session, added a control, read status `input`, and deleted with `204`; `cd api && python -m pytest tests/ -v` passed with 25 tests; `cd kpmg_ui && npm run check` passed.

---

## 2026-05-13 Update - Control Testing V2 Pipeline Stages 1-3

- Scope: implemented CT V2 Plan 2 for the local `ct_worker` service and early pipeline stages: input template parsing, LLM pre-review, evidence/population C&A, sampling, evidence mapping, and API review gates.
- Added `ct_worker` to `docker-compose.yml`, reusing the API image and consuming the dedicated `ct_pipeline` Celery queue via Redis. The worker uses pass-through LLM environment variables only; CT LLM calls use `get_llm()` with no provider/model override so Settings remains authoritative.
- Added `utils/control_assurance/celery_app.py`, prompt builders under `utils/control_assurance/prompts/`, pipeline modules under `utils/control_assurance/pipeline/`, and `utils/control_assurance/evidence_extractor.py`.
- Added a shared LLM JSON helper that retries malformed output once, validates with Pydantic response models, and logs parse failures to `ct_sessions.parse_errors[]`.
- Extended `/ct` APIs with template upload, manual begin-analysis, review suggestions/questions, review confirmation, mapping views/overrides, C&A override, sampling updates, and strict confirm-mapping gate behavior.
- Verification: `docker compose up --build -d ct_worker` built and started the worker; `docker compose logs ct_worker --tail=120` showed `celery@... ready` and registered `ct.parse_template`, `ct.llm_review`, `ct.evidence_mapping`, and `ct.run_testing`; `cd api && python -m pytest tests/ -v` passed with 48 tests.

---

## 2026-05-13 Update - Control Testing V2 Pipeline Stages 4-5

- Scope: implemented CT V2 Plan 3 backend pipeline stages for SOX ITGC testing execution, CT issue drafting, workpaper narrative/workbook generation, control result APIs, issue push integration, and sign-off.
- Added Stage 4 prompt/worker behavior for canonical `todi_results`, `sample_results[].sample_num`, `application`, `item_reference`, `exceptions[].ref`, issue refs, >20% OE threshold enforcement, `W` tickmark normalization out of sample rows, per-control checkpoints, CT issue drafting into `ct_issues`, and Stage 5 dispatch.
- Added Stage 5 narrative and workbook generation with `SOX_ITGC_Testing_Workpaper_v2.xlsx` as the preferred base template and GridFS metadata `{type, session_id, control_id, filename}` for workbook outputs.
- Extended `/ct` APIs with control result list/detail, CT issue list/detail/update/push/push-all, idempotent issue pushing into the main `issues` collection, and sign-off updates.
- Added focused backend validation plus agreed edge/static tests covering C&A gate null states, no-evidence blocking, override pass-through and logs, checkpointing, tickmark/exception consistency, OE boundary behavior, GridFS metadata, delete cascade, push-all skip behavior, `get_llm()` no-override static scan, Celery resilience flags, and Redis AOF config.
- Verification: `python -m pytest api\tests -v` passed with 83 tests; `docker compose build fastapi_api ct_worker` passed; `docker compose up -d fastapi_api ct_worker` recreated both services; `docker compose ps fastapi_api ct_worker` showed FastAPI healthy and CT worker up; `docker compose logs ct_worker --tail=80` showed all five CT tasks registered including `ct.generate_workbooks`.

## 2026-05-12 Update - TRACE Ribbon Standardization

- Scope: standardized the feature-page ribbon colour treatment while preserving existing shared ribbon sizing across other features.
- Updated the shared `.hero-section` styling in `kpmg_ui/client/src/styles/kpmg-brand-override.css` to use the darker Asset Registry navy base and subtle purple/cobalt radial accents instead of the previous bright cobalt sweep. The existing shared hero padding values were left unchanged.
- Switched `kpmg_ui/client/src/pages/asset-registry.tsx` to the shared `HeroSection` so its ribbon height matches the rest of the app, and removed the hero-level Add Asset / Filter Register controls. Register filters remain visible in the workspace.
- Added `kpmg_ui/client/src/trace-ribbon-style.test.ts` and updated `kpmg_ui/client/src/asset-registry.redesign.test.ts` to guard the shared colour treatment, unchanged shared sizing tokens, compact Asset Registry ribbon, and removed hero controls.
- Verification: focused ribbon and Asset Registry guards passed; `npm run check` passed; `npm run build` passed with existing PostCSS `from` and chunk-size warnings; rebuilt/recreated `web_ui_agent`, confirmed healthy on port 5000, and captured live screenshots at `output/playwright/asset-registry-live-redesign.png` and `output/playwright/dashboard-ribbon-standardized.png`.

---

## 2026-05-12 Update - Asset Registry UI Redesign

- Scope: redesigned `kpmg_ui/client/src/pages/asset-registry.tsx` after the approved mockups, keeping the route, context contract, CIA scoring widget, create/delete/select actions, and suggested-control workflow intact.
- Replaced the old registry view with the TRACE feature ribbon, inline KPMG-style hero, KPI strip, searchable/filterable register workspace, selected-asset inspector, asset dossier, controls mapping view, and shell-contained create panel.
- Added `kpmg_ui/client/src/asset-registry.redesign.test.ts` as a static regression guard for the approved page structure, required labels, preserved behaviors, shell styling, and palette constraints.
- Verification: focused redesign guard passed; `npm run check` passed; `npm run build` passed with the existing PostCSS `from` and chunk-size warnings; rebuilt/recreated `web_ui_agent`, confirmed it is healthy on port 5000, and captured the live page at `output/playwright/asset-registry-live-redesign.png`.

---

## 2026-05-12 Update - Asset Registry Navigation Restore

- Scope: restored Asset Registry to the shared TRACE shell navigation and Settings > Navigation Visibility list.
- Root cause: `kpmg_ui/client/src/components/AppLayout.tsx` exported its own `HIDEABLE_TABS` list that was missing `/asset-registry`, while the separate helper list already included it. Settings imports the live AppLayout export, so both the left shell and settings visibility list omitted the page.
- Added the `/asset-registry` tab back to the live AppLayout tab model with the existing database-style icon, preserving route behavior and visibility toggling semantics.
- Updated `kpmg_ui/client/src/components/app-layout.helpers.test.ts` so the regression guard checks the runtime AppLayout export rather than only the stale helper list.
- Verification: watched the focused nav regression fail before the fix and pass after it; `npm run check` passed; `npm run build` passed with the existing PostCSS `from` and chunk-size warnings; rebuilt and recreated `web_ui_agent`, which is healthy on port 5000.

---

## 2026-05-11 Update - Feature Shell Navigation and Footer Polish

- Scope: refined the shared KPMG TRACE feature-page shell used by the sidebar modules without changing routes, backend contracts, or page workflows.
- Updated the shared feature breadcrumb ribbon so `KPMG | TRACE / Feature` includes an explicit back affordance to `/landing`, matching the requested feature landing-page structure.
- Added shared shell height tokens so the sidebar brand header and top feature ribbon align visually, creating a seamless top band across the shell.
- Compacted the global feature footer into a single-line, truncated legal strip and tightened the sidebar user footer area so the bottom bands feel integrated and take less vertical space.
- Follow-up: patched Dashboard, Regulatory Library, and Controls Library, which were bypassing the shared feature hero through page-local banners or direct nav-only headers; Controls Library also no longer renders a duplicate in-page footer.
- Added static frontend guards in `kpmg_ui/client/src/components/app-layout.sidebar.test.ts` for the shared shell height tokens, landing back navigation, compact footer, and integrated sidebar user treatment.

---

## 2026-05-11 Update - Document Uplift UX Redesign

- Scope: redesigned the Document Uplift frontend into a shell-contained landing dashboard and case workspace based on `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-08-document-uplift-ux-redesign.md`, using the TRACE/Controls Library visual language.
- Replaced the monolithic `kpmg_ui/client/src/pages/document-uplift.tsx` with the landing dashboard: hero, KPI strip, collapsible How It Works, searchable case list, create/delete dialogs, and insights rail.
- Added `kpmg_ui/client/src/pages/document-uplift-case.tsx` for `/document-uplift/:caseId` inside the existing `AppLayout`: compact case header, Documents, Processing, Review Suggestions, and Export tabs with internal scrolling so the UI fits the TRACE shell.
- Cloned the useful `docx-preview` pattern from the SOP Uplift page into local Document Uplift code only; there are no imports or runtime dependencies on `pages/sop-uplift/**`.
- Added a read-only `GET /document-uplift/cases/{case_id}/files/{file_id}/content` endpoint so the browser can preview already-uploaded DOCX/XLSX inputs. No backend suggestion generation, review semantics, output generation, or SOP processing code was changed.
- Updated frontend source guards for the split route architecture and added `kpmg_ui/client/src/document-uplift.redesign.test.ts`. Added backend coverage for the preview content endpoint in `tests/test_document_uplift_api.py`.
- Verification: `tests/test_document_uplift_api.py` passed; frontend guards `document-uplift.item29`, `document-uplift.item30`, `document-uplift.severity`, and `document-uplift.redesign` passed; `npm run check` and `npm run build` passed with the existing PostCSS/chunk-size warnings.

---

## 2026-05-08 Update - Control Testing Workpaper Template Path Fix

- Scope: fixed the legacy `/audit/generate-workpaper` path used by `kpmg_ui/client/src/pages/control-testing.tsx` during the Generate Workpaper step.
- Root cause: `api/main.py` resolved the Excel template as `api/utils/Consolidated_WP_Template.xlsx`, but the packaged template lives at `utils/Consolidated_WP_Template.xlsx`. In Docker this surfaced as `FileNotFoundError: /app/api/utils/Consolidated_WP_Template.xlsx`.
- Added `_workpaper_template_path()` in `api/main.py` so the route resolves the repo/package-level `utils` directory from `api/main.py` reliably in local and container runtimes.
- Added regression coverage in `tests/test_control_testing_api.py` to assert the resolved template path points to an existing packaged template.
- Verification: watched the new focused test fail before the fix, then pass; full `python -m pytest tests/test_control_testing_api.py -q` passed with 10 tests. Rebuilt/recreated `fastapi_api`; container check confirmed `/app/utils/Consolidated_WP_Template.xlsx` exists and both `http://localhost:8000/health` and `http://localhost:5000/api/health` return OK.

---

## 2026-05-07 Update - Document Uplift Domain-Agnostic Analysis Addendum

- Scope: implemented the Checkpoint C addendum to broaden Document Uplift analysis beyond RCM-shaped evidence while preserving the original service architecture and keeping Document Uplift independent from `utils/sop_uplift/`.
- Added `docs/document-uplift-severity-calculation.md` as a focused severity/confidence reference. The full architecture/components/processes document is intentionally deferred until the original Document Uplift plan is complete.
- Added normalized fact/finding models in `utils/services/schemas.py`: `DocumentFact`, `NormalizedFinding`, `DiscoveryCandidate`, expanded severity vocabulary (`critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`, `informational`), richer `SourceReference`, corpus-map extensions, and `agent_follow_up_questions`.
- Added `utils/services/severity.py`, `utils/services/semantic_roles.py`, and `utils/services/generic_findings.py` for deterministic severity helpers, semantic field-role classification, generic structured-document fact generation, seed finding detection, discovery routing, and suggestion mapping.
- Updated `utils/services/excel_pipeline.py` so non-RCM structured documents preserve `_raw_attributes`, `_semantic_roles`, and `_source`, emit normalized facts, and can generate generic high-confidence suggestions without requiring `risk_id` or `control_id`.
- Updated `utils/sop_processing/case_store.py` and `utils/sop_processing/pipeline.py` to persist detailed facts in a separate `document_uplift_facts` collection, keep large facts outside `document_uplift_cases`, merge generic finding summaries, and route low-confidence ambiguity to follow-up questions rather than uplift suggestions.
- Updated `utils/services/analysis.py` to preserve the full severity vocabulary from LLM suggestions and to map unknown raw suggestion categories back to `process_improvement` instead of dropping them.
- Updated `kpmg_ui/client/src/pages/document-uplift.tsx` and added `kpmg_ui/client/src/document-uplift.severity.test.ts` so the UI supports and sorts `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`, and `informational`.
- Added/expanded coverage in `tests/services/test_severity.py`, `tests/services/test_schemas.py`, `tests/services/test_semantic_roles.py`, `tests/services/test_generic_findings.py`, `tests/services/test_excel_pipeline.py`, `tests/services/test_analysis.py`, and `tests/test_document_uplift_pipeline.py`.
- Verification run: 92 backend tests passed across the Document Uplift addendum, API, and settings slice; frontend guards `document-uplift.item29`, `document-uplift.item30`, and `document-uplift.severity` passed; `npm run check` and `npm run build` passed with existing PostCSS/chunk-size warnings.
- Original-plan human gates from that checkpoint were later confirmed complete on 2026-05-11: manual Word 365 review, T8 human usefulness review, and T9 cross-domain usefulness review.

## 2026-05-07 Update - Document Uplift Items 32 and 33 Queue Infrastructure

- Scope: completed the remaining technical infrastructure items from the original Document Uplift plan: Item 32 Celery/Redis wiring and Item 33 final asyncio queue.
- Added `redis` and `celery_worker` services to `docker-compose.yml`. The Celery worker uses the existing API image and starts `celery -A utils.sop_processing.celery_app worker` over the `document_uplift,conversion,chunking,excel,llm,analysis,outputs` queues.
- Added `CELERY_BROKER_URL`, `CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND`, `TASK_BACKEND`, `DOCUMENT_UPLIFT_ASYNC_WORKERS`, `DOCUMENT_UPLIFT_QUEUE_MAXSIZE`, and `DOCUMENT_UPLIFT_PIPELINE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` environment settings.
- Added `celery==5.4.0` and `redis==5.0.4` to both API and root requirements.
- Added `utils/sop_processing/celery_app.py` with the Celery app, task routes, full Document Uplift pipeline task, and small-result service wrappers. Redis never receives markdown, chunk arrays, or full analysis payloads.
- Replaced the interim asyncio `to_thread` dispatch path in `utils/sop_processing/pipeline.py` with `AsyncPipelineQueue`: bounded queue, fixed workers, duplicate-case protection, back-pressure errors, graceful shutdown, and `run_in_executor` for blocking pipeline work.
- FastAPI lifespan in `api/main.py` now starts/stops the async queue when `TASK_BACKEND=asyncio`; celery mode enqueues through Celery and keeps pipeline work outside the API process.
- `DocumentUpliftCaseStore.get_case()` now marks stale running jobs as failed after `DOCUMENT_UPLIFT_PIPELINE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`.
- Router dispatch errors map to HTTP 409 for duplicate queued/running cases and HTTP 429 when the async queue is full.
- Added tests in `tests/test_document_uplift_infrastructure.py` and expanded `tests/test_document_uplift_pipeline.py` for Celery dispatch, queue behavior, executor usage, stale timeout, and Compose/requirements wiring.
- Verification run: 99 backend tests passed across the Document Uplift, infrastructure, API, and settings slice; frontend guards passed; `npm run check`, `npm run build`, `docker compose config --quiet`, and `docker compose --dry-run build fastapi_api celery_worker` passed.
- Human gates were confirmed complete on 2026-05-11: manual Word 365 review, T8 suggestion usefulness review, and T9 cross-domain usefulness review. T4 restart/retry reliability was verified on 2026-05-11; Redis and Celery are wired and healthy. The final architecture/components/process document is now `docs/document-uplift-architecture.md`.

---

## 2026-05-06 Update - Document Uplift Service Foundation

- Scope: implemented Track B Items 7 and 8 only for the new service-based Document Uplift feature; existing SOP Uplift code remains untouched.
- Added `utils/services/__init__.py` and `utils/services/schemas.py` as the shared stateless schema layer for Document Uplift services.
- Added `tests/services/test_schemas.py` with schema contract coverage for identity literals, conversion/chunk defaults, LLM cost records, Excel corpus maps, suggestions, `AnalysisResult`, swimlane output, and `DocumentUpliftCase` defaults.
- Added `utils/services/conversion.py` as the new stateless conversion service for DOCX, PDF, Excel, text, corruption detection, and DOCX style extraction for procedure/policy tags.
- Added `tests/services/test_conversion.py` with contract coverage for DOCX markdown, procedure/policy style profiles, Excel routing as `xlsx`, unsupported extensions, and corrupt PDF partial status.
- Added `utils/services/llm_orchestrator.py` as the new stateless LLM orchestration service with budget checks, JSON retry, call records, cost calculation, and model-aware batch sizing.
- Added `tests/services/test_llm_orchestrator.py` with contract coverage for budget exhaustion, successful JSON calls, call telemetry, malformed JSON retry, Ollama zero-cost, Gemini Flash cost, and batch sizing.
- Added `utils/services/excel_pipeline.py` as the new structured Excel pipeline with schema detection, merged-cell propagation, row completeness scanning, and corpus map output.
- Added `tests/services/test_excel_pipeline.py` with coverage for 500-row RCM processing, ownership gaps, merged cells, row-2 headers, multi-sheet handling, empty-sheet skipping, budget skipping, corpus maps, and capped RowGap-derived suggestions.
- Added `utils/services/analysis.py` as the Item 13 skeleton `analyze_documents()` interface only; full Stage 1 extraction remains deferred to later plan items.
- Added `tests/services/test_analysis.py` with skeleton success and budget-exhaustion coverage.
- Added `utils/sop_processing/sse_events.py` as the Item 18 SSE formatting helper only; no router endpoint was added.
- Added `tests/sop_processing/test_sse_events.py` with SSE event formatting coverage.
- Added Document Uplift budget config helpers in `utils/llm_config_store.py`: `get_document_uplift_config()` and `save_document_uplift_config()`, backed by MongoDB and seeded from `MAX_LLM_CALLS_PER_PIPELINE` only when absent.
- Added `tests/test_settings.py` coverage for reading the DB budget, env seeding, and clamping to the 5-200 range.
- Added `utils/sop_processing/content_sanitizer.py` and `utils/sop_processing/prompts.py` for Item 20, including FD7 delimiter wrapping, injection-risk screening, truncation, all eight prompt templates, and prompt version constants.
- Added `tests/sop_processing/test_content_sanitizer.py` and `tests/test_prompts.py` coverage for sanitizer behavior and prompt contracts.
- Plan/schema correction: Item 11 required a capped `Suggestion` list from RowGap entries, so `ExcelPipelineResult.suggestions` was added to `utils/services/schemas.py` and documented in the plan’s Topic 1 block.
- Build tracking: `docs/document-uplift-build-log.md` marks Items 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 18, 19, and 20 complete and records the red/green TDD evidence.
- Verification: `python -m pytest tests/test_settings.py tests/test_prompts.py tests/services/ tests/sop_processing/ -v` reports 66 passed with one Pydantic warning for the plan-required `SheetResult.schema` field name.
- Next Document Uplift item: Item 16, but it is blocked because the implementation table lists deferred Track A Item 4 as a dependency.

---

## 2026-05-06 Update - Risk Assessment Page-Local UI Overhaul

- Scope: page-local redesign of `kpmg_ui/client/src/pages/risk-assessment.tsx`; route, providers, backend contracts, and all non-risk-assessment features were deliberately left unchanged.
- New page structure: a TRACE-style assessment workspace with a session rail, dashboard state, create-assessment workspace, and a clearer selected-assessment workflow.
- Preserved workflow stages: `Create`, `Questionnaire`, `Analyse`, `Risks`, `Controls`, `Residual`, and `Report`.
- Functionality preserved: assessment creation, asset loading, section loading, batch questionnaire submission, automatic analysis trigger, control suggestions, control application, residual fetch, report generation, and direct assessment refresh.
- Data sources preserved: `useRiskAssessment()`, `useAssetRegistry()`, and the existing direct refresh call to `GET /api/risk-assessment/{id}`.
- New browser smoke markers: `data-risk-assessment-page`, `data-risk-assessment-rail`, `data-risk-assessment-dashboard`, `data-risk-assessment-create`, `data-risk-assessment-stepper`, `data-risk-assessment-questionnaire`, `data-risk-assessment-analysis`, `data-risk-assessment-risks`, `data-risk-assessment-controls`, `data-risk-assessment-residual`, and `data-risk-assessment-report`.
- Design references added: `docs/ui-overhaul/risk-assessment-design.md`, `docs/ui-overhaul/risk-assessment-mockups.html`, `docs/ui-overhaul/risk-assessment-mockups-board-1.svg`, `docs/ui-overhaul/risk-assessment-mockups-board-2.svg`, and the Risk Assessment entry in `docs/ui-overhaul/ui-overhaul-log.md`.
- Regression coverage added: `kpmg_ui/client/src/risk-assessment.overhaul.test.ts`.
- Verification run: `node --import tsx .\client\src\risk-assessment.overhaul.test.ts`, `npm run check`, and `npm run build`. Build completed with the existing Vite chunk-size and PostCSS `from` option warnings only.

---

## 2026-05-04 Update - SOP Uplift Suggestion Parsing Robustness

- Root cause: useful LLM suggestion responses could be discarded when the model returned structured warning objects instead of plain warning strings. The same strict parsing could invalidate full-document extraction when role/lane hints were returned as objects.
- Fix: `utils/sop_uplift/llm_schemas.py` now normalizes structured warnings and role labels into concise strings, keeps valid suggestions, accepts low-confidence corpus notes as message objects, and makes case-finalization diagram payloads lenient so malformed diagram details do not invalidate the whole finalization response.
- Regression coverage: `tests/test_sop_uplift_modules.py` adds focused tests for preserving suggestions with structured warnings and accepting structured role/warning items from full-document extraction.
- Verification run: `python -m pytest tests/test_sop_uplift_modules.py tests/test_sop_uplift_api.py tests/test_sop_uplift_pipeline.py -q` and `node --import tsx .\client\src\pages\sop-uplift.integration.test.ts`.

---

## 2026-05-04 Update - Dashboard Page-Local UI Overhaul

- Scope: page-local redesign of `kpmg_ui/client/src/pages/dashboard.tsx`; app shell, sidebar, footer, auth flow, routes, providers, APIs, and feature workflows were deliberately left unchanged.
- New Dashboard structure: `Overview`, `Libraries`, `Workflows`, and `Exceptions` tabs. `Overview` follows the approved mockup with a compact dark `DASHBOARD` banner, eight KPI tiles, primary chart grid, `Domain Coverage`, and `Testing Sessions By Status`.
- Data sources preserved and reused: `useLibraryMetrics()`, `useCrossNav()`, `useAssetRegistry()`, `useRiskAssessment()`, `useIssueManagement()`, `useChatContext()`, `/api/settings/system-status`, `/api/control-testing`, `/api/rcm-reports`, `/api/sop-uplift/cases`, `/api/frameworks-library/documents`, `/api/frameworks-library/all-elements`, and existing `setLocation(...)` navigation.
- Dashboard does not add `/api/dashboard-summary` or backend aggregation. Empty states are numeric/source-backed only.
- Design references created: `docs/ui-overhaul/dashboard-design.md` and `docs/ui-overhaul/ui-overhaul-log.md`.
- Regression coverage: `kpmg_ui/client/src/dashboard.overhaul.test.ts` asserts the tab model, default tab, smoke-test tab attributes, preserved status endpoint, no dashboard-summary endpoint, and reference docs.
- Verification run: `node --import tsx .\client\src\dashboard.overhaul.test.ts`, `npm run check`, `npm run build`, plus Playwright smoke on `http://localhost:5175/` for sign-in, tab switching, refresh, mobile resize, and browser console errors.

## 2026-05-07 Update - Dashboard Option 3 Chart-System Refinement

- Scope: dashboard-only refinement of `kpmg_ui/client/src/pages/dashboard.tsx` after live review of label collisions, undersized donut charts, uneven chart motion, low-value `Chat Activity`, and an orphaned `Testing Sessions By Status` card on `Overview`.
- New chart-system behavior: shared bar-chart label density modes, centered framed donut charts with total readouts, shared horizontal/segmented fill animation, and tightened chart card composition across tabs.
- New tab composition:
  - `Overview`: four KPI cards, `Assets By Criticality`, `Assessments By Status`, `Issues By Severity`, `Reports By Type`, and `Domain Coverage`.
  - `Workflows`: module health row plus `Testing Sessions By Status`, `Control Test Results`, `SOP Cases By Status`, and `Reports By Type`.
  - `Chat Activity` removed from the dashboard.
- Data sources preserved: `useLibraryMetrics()`, `useCrossNav()`, `useAssetRegistry()`, `useRiskAssessment()`, `useIssueManagement()`, `/api/settings/system-status`, `/api/control-testing`, `/api/rcm-reports`, `/api/sop-uplift/cases`, `/api/frameworks-library/documents`, `/api/frameworks-library/all-elements`, and existing `setLocation(...)` navigation.
- Design references added: `docs/ui-overhaul/dashboard-option-3-mockups.html` and `docs/ui-overhaul/dashboard-option-3-chart-system.html`. Existing dashboard reference docs were updated to match the shipped composition.

---

## 2026-05-04 Update - Controls Library Page-Local UI Overhaul

- Scope: page-local redesign of `kpmg_ui/client/src/pages/controls-library.tsx`; route, app shell, providers, backend contracts, and data model were deliberately left unchanged.
- New Controls Library structure: one scrollable page with `Upload Policy Documents`, `Documents`, a scoped `Library Dashboard`, `5W1H Quality Charts`, and `5W1H Scores by Control`.
- Duplicate dashboard tabs were removed. The unified dashboard now uses `All Uploaded Database` / `Selected Document` scope so metrics, charts, and table rows can reflect the whole library or one uploaded document.
- Functionality preserved: upload, queued file removal, ingest polling, document selection, delete, clear library, refresh, `Map Obligations`, merged view, backend 5W1H quality analysis, CSV export, mapped obligation navigation, and control detail modal.
- Data sources preserved: `/api/controls-library/documents`, `/api/controls-library/documents/{document_id}`, `/api/controls-library/ingest`, `/api/ingest-task/{task_id}`, `/api/controls-library/remap-obligations`, `/api/controls-library/all-controls`, `/api/controls-library/merged`, `/api/controls-library/quality-analysis`, `useCrossNav()`, and `useLibraryMetrics()`.
- Design reference created: `docs/ui-overhaul/controls-library-design.md`; running log updated in `docs/ui-overhaul/ui-overhaul-log.md`.
- Regression coverage: `kpmg_ui/client/src/controls-library.overhaul.test.ts` asserts preserved endpoints/handlers, scope model, approved one-page section markers, removal of duplicate dashboard tabs, and documentation updates.
- Verification run: `node --import tsx .\client\src\controls-library.overhaul.test.ts`, `npm run check`, `npm run build`, `docker compose build web_ui_agent`, `docker compose up -d --force-recreate web_ui_agent`, `docker compose ps`, and HTTP 200 on `http://localhost:5000/`.
- Browser smoke note: Playwright CLI open was attempted, but local Playwright Chrome was missing and `install-browser chrome` failed due insufficient install privileges.
- 413 fix: Quality analysis now sends capped, batched frontend requests to `/api/controls-library/quality-analysis` instead of posting the full controls corpus in one JSON body. This addresses Express HTTP 413 errors on larger uploaded libraries while preserving the endpoint and backend behavior.
- Quality display fix: Controls Library no longer auto-populates 5W1H-derived dashboard values on page load or immediately after ingest. Quality KPIs, charts, table scoring, CSV export, and detail quality fields show `Data not available` until `Run Quality Check` is clicked.
- Backend `Analysis unavailable` fallback rows are excluded from scoring visuals and listed as unavailable analysis instead of being counted as real `0/6` red findings.
- Visual polish: Controls Library chart typography and graph colors were standardized to TRACE/KPMG tokens, and the control detail modal was restyled as a light TRACE dialog without changing its data or obligation navigation behavior.
- Combined analysis update: the visible `Map Obligations` and `Run Quality Check` actions were consolidated into one `Run Analysis` button that refreshes obligation mappings before running 5W1H quality scoring. `Quality RAG by Process Area` now shows readable TRACE-styled domain bars and `Tagged Domains` pills.

## 2026-05-05 Update - Regulatory Testing Page-Local UI Overhaul

- Scope: page-local redesign of `kpmg_ui/client/src/pages/regulatory-testing.tsx`; route, app shell, context, backend endpoints, payload construction, and export handlers were deliberately left unchanged.
- New landing/setup structure: `Regulation vs Regulation` and `RCM vs Regulation` are explicit path cards, followed by the existing upload/library source selectors and a `Run Readiness` card.
- New result structure: post-run output is a four-view workbench: `Summary`, `Domain Drilldown`, `Gap Analysis`, and `Report`.
- Functionality preserved: Regulation A/B upload or library selection, RCM file upload, RCM baseline selection from library or upload, run comparison, export JSON, export markdown report, export PDF, and new comparison reset.
- Data sources preserved: `/api/regulatory-library/documents`, `/api/compare-regulations`, `/api/rcm_compliance_v2`, `/api/rcm_compliance`, and `/api/regulatory-library/gap-analysis/pdf`.
- Design reference created: `docs/ui-overhaul/regulatory-testing-design.md`; running log updated in `docs/ui-overhaul/ui-overhaul-log.md`.
- Regression coverage: `kpmg_ui/client/src/regulatory-testing.overhaul.test.ts` asserts preserved endpoints/actions, redesigned setup/result smoke markers, approved labels, no synthetic feed copy, and documentation updates.
- Verification run: `node --import tsx .\client\src\regulatory-testing.overhaul.test.ts`, `node --import tsx .\client\src\pages\regulatory-testing.helpers.test.ts`, `npm run check`, `npm run build`, `docker compose build web_ui_agent`, `docker compose up -d --force-recreate web_ui_agent`, HTTP 200 on `http://localhost:5000/regulatory-testing`, and Playwright CLI smoke on Microsoft Edge for sign-in, setup render, RCM mode switch, mobile resize, and console errors. Vite emitted the existing chunk-size and PostCSS `from` option warnings.
- Setup layout correction: Regulation A/B now uses explicit high-contrast source toggles, compact library selection rows, bounded source-card grid columns, and `min-w-0` guards to avoid horizontal page scroll. Verification rerun: `node --import tsx .\client\src\regulatory-testing.overhaul.test.ts` and `npm run check`. Containers were not rebuilt for this correction per active UI testing request.
- Result presentation correction: post-run views now use short source labels, a plain-language summary insight, `Coverage By Domain`, a clearer `Gap Matrix`, and a styled `Formatted Report` preview with title-cased markdown headings. Verification rerun: `node --import tsx .\client\src\regulatory-testing.overhaul.test.ts` and `npm run check`. Containers were not rebuilt for this correction per active UI testing request.

## 2026-05-03 Update - SOP Uplift DOCX Export Formatting

- Root cause: `utils/sop_uplift/rewrite_generator.py` generated uplift DOCX files with a fresh `Document()` package, so exported SOPs lost the uploaded Word document's template, paragraph styles, tables, and visual context.
- Fix: SOP/policy `.docx` uploads are now selected as the export base when generating SOP Uplift outputs. The original DOCX package remains intact, and accepted/edited suggestions are inserted as visible `TRACE Uplift Change [...]` blocks near the matched source paragraph.
- Change clarity: generated DOCX exports also append a `TRACE Change Register` with process metadata, original struck-through SOP language, applied SOP language, and rejected suggestions.
- Fallback behavior: cases without a usable source `.docx` continue to use the existing generated DOCX path.
- Regression coverage: `test_generate_docx_preserves_source_docx_formatting_and_inserts_change_blocks` and `test_generate_outputs_uses_uploaded_sop_docx_as_formatted_export_base`.
- Verification run: `python -m pytest tests/test_sop_uplift_api.py tests/test_sop_uplift_outputs.py tests/test_sop_uplift_modules.py tests/test_sop_uplift_persistence_and_prompts.py tests/test_sop_uplift_pipeline.py -q`.

---

## 2026-05-03 Update - SOP Uplift Extraction Latency

- Root cause: full-document SOP Uplift LLM extraction bypassed `max_chunk_chars` by expanding the sanitizer cap to the full document length. Large workbook-derived markdown could be sent to the LLM nearly whole, leaving the UI modal stuck in "Analyzing full documents with AI" for minutes.
- Fix: `utils/sop_uplift/pipeline.py` now honors the configured prompt-size cap for document-level extraction.
- Follow-up speed fix: full-document LLM extraction now runs only for confirmed SOP/policy documents. RCMs, risk registers, evidence, audit reports, and other supporting files stay on the deterministic extraction path and are passed into `case_sop_uplift_suggestions` as compact context.
- Prompt-size controls: SOP/policy full-document prompts now budget anchors with `SOP_UPLIFT_MAX_ANCHORS_PER_PROMPT`, `SOP_UPLIFT_ANCHOR_EXCERPT_CHARS`, and `SOP_UPLIFT_ANCHOR_TEXT_BUDGET_CHARS`. Anchor summaries keep `anchor_id` and `section_path`, omit excerpts already present in the capped body, and cap additional excerpt text.
- Prompt telemetry: `run_json_prompt()` records `prompt_chars`, `raw_chars`, `duration_ms`, `attempts`, and `stage` on prompt run records.
- Regression coverage: `tests/test_sop_uplift_pipeline.py::test_full_pipeline_caps_full_document_prompt_to_max_chunk_chars`.
- Additional regression coverage: `test_full_pipeline_runs_deep_document_analysis_only_for_sop_and_policy_documents`, `test_full_pipeline_skips_deep_document_analysis_when_no_sop_or_policy_is_tagged`, `test_full_document_prompt_anchor_budget_omits_body_duplicates_and_respects_limits`, and prompt telemetry assertions in `tests/test_sop_uplift_persistence_and_prompts.py`.
- Verification run: `python -m pytest tests/test_sop_uplift_pipeline.py -v`, `python -m pytest tests/test_sop_uplift_api.py -v`, and `python -m pytest tests/test_sop_uplift_persistence_and_prompts.py -v`.

## 1. What Is TRACE?

**TRACE** (Control Tester 3000 / KPMG Audit Platform) is a **cybersecurity audit and compliance assessment platform** built for internal auditors and risk practitioners. It uses a local LLM (Ollama + Llama3:8b) with RAG (FAISS / MongoDB) to:

- Ingest and manage enterprise control libraries, regulatory frameworks, and frameworks
- Run structured risk assessments via LLM-assisted questionnaires
- Test controls against uploaded evidence documents
- Map controls to regulatory obligations
- Score control quality using 5W1H methodology
- Raise and track issues and validation queue items
- Generate markdown audit workpapers and final reports

The platform is **not a SaaS product** — it runs fully locally via Docker Compose on a Windows 11 machine with a local Ollama GPU inference server.

---

## 2. Technology Stack

| Layer | Tech |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React 18 + TypeScript, Vite, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui, Recharts |
| BFF / Proxy | Express.js (`kpmg_ui/server/routes.ts`) — strips `/api` prefix, forwards to FastAPI |
| Backend | FastAPI (Python 3.11) |
| Database | MongoDB (`trace_db`) via pymongo |
| LLM | Ollama — `llama3:8b` for generation, `nomic-embed-text` for embeddings |
| LLM Abstraction | `utils/llm_provider.py` → `get_llm()` — **always use this, never hardcode Gemini or any model** |
| Containers | Docker Compose: `mongodb`, `fastapi_api`, `web_ui_agent` |
| Ports | Web UI: 5000, FastAPI: 8000, Ollama: 11434 |

### Service Names (Docker)
```
mongodb               → mongodb:27017
fastapi_api           → fastapi_api:8000
web_ui_agent          → agent_assess_web (port 5000)
```

### Key Commands
```bash

## 4. What Has Been Built (Sub-Projects)

### SP1 — Issue Management
**Status: Complete**

- **Backend:** `api/routers/issues.py` — full CRUD for issues, evidence attachment, status workflow (`Open → In Progress → Resolved → Closed`, also `Returned`)
- **Backend:** `api/routers/validation_queue.py` — accept/dismiss queue items raised by 5W1H analysis
- **Frontend:** `kpmg_ui/client/src/pages/issue-management.tsx` — two-panel layout with severity/status filter dropdowns, Validation Queue tab
- **Context:** `IssueManagementContext.tsx`
- **MongoDB collection:** `issues`, `validation_queue` in `trace_db`

### SP2 — Asset Registry
**Status: Complete**

- **Backend:** `api/routers/assets.py` — CRUD with CIA scoring, `compute_cia_total()`, criticality bands (Low/Medium/High/Critical)
- **Model fields:** `name`, `type` (Application/Hardware/Database/Interface/API/Network/Desktop/Other), `hosting_type`, `support_type`, `confidentiality`, `confidentiality_min`, `integrity`, `integrity_min`, `availability`, `availability_min`, `owner`, `custodian`, `location`, `jurisdiction`, `classification`, `status`
- **CIA ranges:** Each CIA dimension stores both a max value AND a min value (for range assessments). The `cia_total` uses max values for risk-conservative scoring.
- **Frontend:** `asset-registry.tsx` with `CiaRatingWidget` (click to select, click-drag for range), asset detail panel, control suggestions via LLM
- **Context:** `AssetRegistryContext.tsx`

**Important note:** `owner`, `custodian`, `jurisdiction`, `classification` all have defaults (`""`, `""`, `""`, `"Internal"`) — they are NOT required to create an asset. Only `name` and `description` are required for form submission.

### SP3 — Risk Assessment
**Status: Complete + Wizard fully rewritten**

- **Backend:** `api/routers/risk_assessment.py`
  - `POST /risk-assessment/` — create assessment with asset IDs + optional ad hoc apps
  - `POST /risk-assessment/{id}/respond` — save a single Q&A response (still exists)
  - `POST /risk-assessment/{id}/respond-batch` — **NEW** — save all responses for one asset in a single HTTP call (replaces per-question loop)
  - `POST /risk-assessment/{id}/analyze` — hybrid rule-layer + LLM risk identification
  - `POST /risk-assessment/{id}/controls` — apply a control to a risk
  - `POST /risk-assessment/{id}/suggest-controls` — rank controls from library against identified risks
  - `GET /risk-assessment/{id}/residual` — compute residual risk post-controls
  - `POST /risk-assessment/{id}/generate-report` — markdown report
- **Question bank:** `utils/assessment_questions.py` — 8 sections (~12 questions each)
- **Ad hoc applications:** `asset_ids` in MongoDB already includes ad hoc app IDs (merged at create time). Frontend questionnaire tab bar shows all `asset_ids` (real + ad hoc) uniformly.
- **Frontend:** `risk-assessment.tsx` — 7-step wizard: **Create → Questionnaire → Analyse → Risks → Controls → Residual → Report**
- **Context:** `RiskAssessmentContext.tsx` — exports `submitResponseBatch`, `applyControl`

**Key behaviour:**
- **Questionnaire submit:** Uses `submitResponseBatch` — one HTTP call per asset (not per question). Submits all questions including unanswered ones defaulting to "na".
- **Analyse step (step 2):** Auto-triggers `analyzeAssessment` via `useEffect` when step is reached. Shows loading spinner only — no button. Auto-advances to Risks when complete.
- **Controls step (step 4):** Shows suggested controls per risk (auto-fetched via `suggestControls`). User clicks "Apply" per control. Already-applied controls show checkmark.
- **Residual step (step 5):** Auto-fetches residual via `useEffect` on step enter. Shows loading spinner then table.
- **Sticky submit bar** pinned to top of questionnaire; shows asset count and answered count.
- Section progress counter and `answeredCount` both count all answers including N/A.
- Analyse endpoint is lenient when `ra.responses` is empty (logs warning, proceeds with CIA-only scoring).

### SP4 — Control Testing
**Status: Complete**

- **Backend:** `api/routers/control_testing.py`
  - Full testing session lifecycle: Create → Upload Evidence → LLM Evidence Review → Generate Report
  - `POST /control-testing/sessions` — create session with controls from library
  - `POST /control-testing/sessions/{id}/upload-evidence` — attach evidence files
  - `POST /control-testing/sessions/{id}/review-evidence` — LLM analysis of evidence against controls
  - `POST /control-testing/sessions/{id}/generate-report` — markdown workpaper
- **Frontend:** `control-testing.tsx` — 4-step persistent wizard, session list in left panel
- **Context:** `ControlTestingContext.tsx`
- **MongoDB collection:** `control_testing_sessions` in `trace_db`

---

## 5. Library Features (in `api/main.py`)

These are large endpoints living in `main.py` (not yet split into routers):

### Controls Library (`/controls-library/*`)
- `POST /controls-library/ingest` — upload Excel/PDF/Word control documents, LLM extracts controls, runs 5W1H analysis, stores in MongoDB
- `GET /controls-library/all-controls` — returns all controls with `mapped_obligations` field
- `GET /controls-library/documents` — list uploaded documents
- `POST /controls-library/quality-analysis` — 5W1H LLM evaluation (BATCH_SIZE=10)
- `POST /controls-library/remap-obligations` — re-map all controls against current regulatory library
- **Auto-triggers on ingest:** 5W1H quality analysis + obligation mapping

**Excel/CSV column detection** (`utils/rcm_compliance_analyzer.py`): Handles flexible headers — CCF-style (`CCF ID`, `Control Domain`, `Control Theme`), ISO-style (`Control Reference`, `Control Title`), generic (`ID`, `Name`, `Description`). Do NOT revert this — it was deliberately broadened.

### Regulatory Library (`/regulatory-library/*`)
- `POST /regulatory-library/ingest` — extract obligations from regulatory PDFs (RBI, MAS TRM, ISO 27001, NIST, etc.)
- `GET /regulatory-library/documents` — list documents
- `GET /regulatory-library/all-obligations` — flat list of all obligations
- `POST /regulatory-library/remap-obligations` — re-map all controls to obligations (auto-triggers after regulatory ingest)
- **LLM extraction:** `utils/regulatory_library.py` — `ObligationExtractorAgent`, BATCH_SIZE=10, MAX_WORKERS=4
- **Extraction prompt** explicitly excludes: document titles, scope/applicability clauses, definitions sections, preambles. Only extracts actual control-level obligations with "shall/must/required/implement" language.

### Frameworks Library (`/frameworks-library/*`)
- Upload framework documents (NIST CSF, ISO 27001, COBIT, etc.)
- Extract framework elements (controls, objectives, domains)
- Auto-seeded with NIST CSF at startup if empty

---

## 6. MongoDB Database

**Database name:** `trace_db` (lowercase — important, was previously `Trace_db` which caused Windows case-sensitivity errors)

| Collection | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `assets` | Asset registry |
| `risk_assessments` | Risk assessment sessions |
| `control_testing_sessions` | Control testing sessions |
| `issues` | Issue management |
| `validation_queue` | 5W1H quality findings awaiting review |
| `controls_library` | Ingested control documents |
| `regulatory_library` | Ingested regulatory obligation documents |
| `frameworks_library` | Ingested framework documents |
| `nist_controls` | NIST CSF seed data |

**Critical:** Four legacy utility files each have their own MongoDB client. All must use `DB_NAME = "trace_db"`:
- `utils/regulatory_library.py`
- `utils/regulatory_comparision.py`
- `utils/controls_library.py`
- `utils/frameworks_library.py`
- `utils/rcm_report_store.py`

---

## 7. LLM / Model Rules

**Always use `get_llm()` from `utils/llm_provider.py`**. Never hardcode `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI`, `ChatOllama`, or any model name directly in router/utility code. `get_llm()` auto-selects Ollama locally or falls back to Gemini if configured.

```python
from utils.llm_provider import get_llm
llm = get_llm()
response = llm.invoke([HumanMessage(content=prompt)])
```

---

## 8. CIA Rating Widget

`kpmg_ui/client/src/components/CiaRatingWidget.tsx`

- Shows 5 buttons (1–5) per dimension (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)
- **Click** a button = select single value (min = max = n)
- **Click and drag** across buttons = select a range (e.g., drag 1→3 highlights 1–2–3)
- Props: `confidentiality`, `confidentiality_min`, `integrity`, `integrity_min`, `availability`, `availability_min`, `onChange(field, min, max)`, `readOnly`
- Used in: `asset-registry.tsx` (create + detail view), `risk-assessment.tsx` (ad hoc app form)

---

## 9. Known Issues / Remaining Work

### SOP Uplift Foundation Added (2026-04-27)

- **Backend:** `api/routers/sop_uplift.py` registered at `/sop-uplift`.
- **Utilities:** `utils/sop_uplift/` now contains V1 modules for case storage, readiness, Markdown conversion, anchors, chunks, content sanitization, tagging, extraction routing, deterministic extractors, corpus mapping, retrieval, rule-based suggestions, prompt templates, JSON LLM orchestration, preview models, DOCX generation, Draw.io/SVG/PDF diagram export, change logs, schema validation, and task state.
- **Frontend:** `kpmg_ui/client/src/pages/sop-uplift.tsx` is routed at `/sop-uplift`, visible in the landing page and sidebar, uses `@xyflow/react` for swimlane preview, and calls case/readiness/chat/analyze/output APIs.
- **Persistence/Reports:** SOP Uplift raw files and generated outputs can be persisted through the SOP Uplift GridFS collection when MongoDB is available, with in-memory fallback for tests. `utils/rcm_report_store.py` supports `report_type="sop_uplift"` records and the Reports page recognizes/downloads SOP Uplift outputs.
- **Amendments implemented:** prompt-injection screening via `content_sanitizer.py`, chunk length capping, structural `<document_content>` delimiters, batch `extract`/`analyze` endpoints, per-stage `processing_state`, CairoSVG-backed diagram PDF path with ReportLab fallback, and SOP Uplift env vars.
- **Current limitation:** Prompt templates and JSON validation are in place, and extract/analyze can opt into the LLM runner, but extraction and suggestions still fall back to deterministic V1 scaffolds. The 21 prompt stages need deeper schema-specific parsing, retry policy, and UX surfacing before this should be treated as complete AI analysis.

### SOP Uplift Swimlane Output Fix (2026-05-03)

- Final generated swimlane artifacts now rebuild the diagram from `revised_sop_sections` at `generate-outputs` time instead of reusing stale `case.diagram_model` preview data.
- Accepted suggestions use `suggested_text`; edited suggestions use `user_text`; rejected and open suggestions are excluded from the implemented process diagram and surfaced through warnings.
- Supporting controls/risks can enrich summaries, but supporting-document-only process steps are not added as flow nodes.
- The swimlane prompt now states the effective SOP source priority, supporting-document enrichment limits, C#/R#/E# anti-invention rules, reference-artifact paths, and sizing/readability guardrails.

### LLM Provider Expansion (2026-05-03)

- Settings now supports `kimi` and `deepseek` alongside Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Ollama.
- Kimi uses the OpenAI-compatible Moonshot endpoint with `kimi-k2.6` as the default model. Set either `MOONSHOT_API_KEY` or `KIMI_API_KEY`; optional vars are `KIMI_BASE_URL`, `KIMI_TEMPERATURE`, and `KIMI_THINKING`.
- DeepSeek defaults to `deepseek-v4-pro` per the current local preference. Other selectable options are `deepseek-v4-flash`, `deepseek-chat`, and `deepseek-reasoner`; set `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, with optional `DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL`, `DEEPSEEK_TEMPERATURE`, `DEEPSEEK_THINKING`, and `DEEPSEEK_REASONING_EFFORT`.
- The Settings Test Connection action can test the currently selected provider/model before saving it.
- Provider-specific client setup remains centralized in `utils/llm_provider.py` and `utils/llm_factory.py`; feature code should still call `get_llm()` or `make_llm()` only.

### Confirmed Bugs (not yet fixed as of last session)
None critical — all reported bugs have been fixed and deployed.

### Functional Gaps / TODO
1. **Exception Management** — removed from sidebar entirely (there is no such module in TRACE).
2. **Issue Management → Evidence attachment UI** — backend supports it but frontend doesn't have file upload in the issue detail panel.
3. **Control Testing — control selection from library** — currently selects all controls in a session; should allow filtering by domain before starting.
4. **Regulatory Library quality** — LLM still occasionally extracts near-obligation sentences (e.g., applicability statements) despite the improved prompt. Would benefit from post-processing filter scoring `enforcement_level`.
5. **5W1H analysis performance** — with 300+ controls, takes ~30 min on CPU Ollama. Quality results only appear after the full batch completes; no streaming progress to the UI.
6. **Regulatory mappings per control** — `mapped_obligations` is populated when a regulatory document is ingested OR when "Re-map" is clicked. If no regulatory documents are uploaded yet, all controls show "No matching obligations found" — this is expected.
7. **Risk Assessment → Inherent risk always scores "Low"** — The rule-layer scoring in `_rule_layer_scores()` (`risk_assessment.py`) is producing low likelihood/impact regardless of questionnaire answers. Likely cause: section/question ID mismatch between what `get_sections()` returns and what the batch-submitted responses store. Debug by logging `section_map` keys vs `r["section_id"]` values on a real submission.
8. **Risk Assessment → Controls step shows no suggestions** — `suggest-controls` endpoint (`POST /{ra_id}/suggest-controls`) is failing silently or returning empty. Check: (a) controls library must be populated first; (b) the LLM prompt in `suggest_controls()` handler may fail if `ra.risks` is empty at call time; (c) check FastAPI logs when "Refresh Suggestions" is clicked.
9. **Risk Assessment → Controls step** — `applyControl` does not currently update `effectiveness_score` (stored as 0.0). Residual calculation uses this, so residual = inherent unless effectiveness is set elsewhere.
8. **Final Report page** — `reports.tsx` exists but unclear if wired to assessment data; needs verification.
9. **Dashboard KPIs** — may not update in real-time after creating assets/assessments; likely needs a refresh trigger.

### UI/UX Gaps
- Issue Management: no inline edit (must delete and re-create)
- Asset Registry: no bulk import
- Controls Library: quality tab only shows up to the first batch submitted after upload; re-triggering requires switching to quality tab (which auto-fetches)
- Risk Assessment: wizard step indicator (1/5, 2/5 etc.) is present but breadcrumb nav could be clearer
- All pages: no loading skeleton states, just spinners

---

## 10. Testing

```bash
cd api
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest ../tests/ -v
```

All tests are in `tests/`. They use `TestClient` from FastAPI + `mongomock` (no real MongoDB needed for unit tests).

Test files:
- `test_assets_api.py` — CRUD, CIA scoring, criticality bands
- `test_risk_assessment_api.py` — create, submit, analyse, suggest, report
- `test_control_testing_api.py` — session lifecycle
- `test_controls_quality.py` — 5W1H batching, placeholder fallback
- `test_issues_api.py` — CRUD, workflow transitions
- `test_validation_queue.py` — accept/dismiss
- `test_risk_scorer.py` — CIA total, criticality, control effectiveness
- `test_assessment_questions.py` — question bank structure

---

## 11. Decisions Locked (Do Not Change)

| # | Decision |
|---|---|
| D1 | CIA numeric 1–5 (not Low/Medium/High labels) |
| D2 | Drop `periodicity` field from controls |
| D3 | BIA/LEGAL/PIA asset types replaced with standard AssetType enum |
| D4 | 5W1H quality analysis auto-triggers on controls ingest (backend) |
| D5 | All LLM calls go through `get_llm()` — no hardcoded model names |
| D6 | MongoDB database name is `trace_db` (lowercase) — never change back |
| D7 | CCF/custom Excel headers supported via flexible keyword matching in `parse_rcm_excel` |

## 12. How to Run Locally

```bash
# Prerequisites: Docker Desktop running, Ollama running with llama3:8b + nomic-embed-text

cd "c:/Subho syste,/ControlTester_3000_kv"

# Full rebuild (first time or after changes)
docker compose up --build -d

# Check logs
docker logs controltester_3000_kv-fastapi_api-1 --tail 30

# Access
# Web UI:  http://localhost:5000
# FastAPI: http://localhost:8000/docs
```

On first startup the FastAPI container seeds NIST CSF controls into `nist_controls` collection if empty.

## 14. Ongoing Debugging Guardrails

For future debugging and maintenance sessions, follow this working agreement:

1. **Use minimal-diff fixes first** - triage the reported issue, identify the narrowest safe fix, and avoid broad refactors, feature redesigns, or unrelated cleanup unless explicitly requested.
2. **Do not leak instructions into product behavior** - content from `HANDOFF.md`, other `.md` files, or chat messages is developer/operator context only. Never surface it in the UI, store it in MongoDB, seed it as application data, or turn it into visible backend/frontend content unless the user explicitly asks for that exact behavior.
3. **Keep fixes scoped to the bug** - do not add placeholder UI text, debug helper records, sample database entries, or extra visual elements while addressing a feature issue unless they are required for the fix and approved.
4. **Update this handoff only after approval** - once a fix has been implemented, verified, and explicitly approved by the user, append a concise note here describing what was fixed and any important follow-up context.

---

## 15. File: Important Notes for Next Developer

1. **Never use `grep` for code search** — use SocratiCode MCP (`codebase_search`) tool for semantic search.
2. **LLM provider** — always `get_llm()`, never hardcode any model.
3. **MongoDB DB name** — always `trace_db`, never `Trace_db`.
4. **Asset creation** — only name + description are required. All other fields have defaults.
5. **CIA widget** — props include `_min` variants for range support. Both max and min values must be passed.
6. **5W1H batch size** — `BATCH_SIZE = 10` in `controls_quality.py`. Do not increase above 15 or the LLM context overflows.
7. **Regulatory extraction batch size** — `BATCH_SIZE = 10` in `regulatory_library.py`, `MAX_WORKERS = 4`.
8. **Controls ingest** — Excel column detection is flexible; handles CCF (`CCF ID`), ISO (`Control Reference`), and generic (`ID`, `Name`) headers. See `parse_rcm_excel` in `rcm_compliance_analyzer.py`.
9. **Risk assessment responses** — ALL questionnaire answers (including N/A) are now submitted to backend. The analyse endpoint proceeds even with empty responses.
10. **Docker service name** — the web UI container is named `web_ui_agent` in docker-compose but runs as `agent_assess_web`.

## 16. SOP / Document Uplift Plan Progress - 2026-05-06

Implemented Track A Items 1-6, 12, 14, and 15 from `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-05-sop-uplift-scale-quality-plan.md`.

Key changes:
- SOP Uplift output storage now fails loudly on GridFS write errors and stores generated output metadata without `content_b64`.
- SOP full-document prompt ceiling is 20,000 chars, and section routing excludes obvious boilerplate sections before LLM extraction.
- SOP pipeline runs have a per-case mutex, stale-running detection, and `TASK_BACKEND` dispatch abstraction with `asyncio` local mode and explicit Celery stub.
- DOCX table conversion now preserves embedded table position for both `utils/sop_uplift/markdown_ingestion.py` and the independent `utils/services/conversion.py` clone.
- SOP schema v2 split storage is in `utils/sop_uplift/case_store.py`: new cases keep markdown/anchors/chunks in `sop_markdown`, `sop_anchors`, and `sop_chunks`; `get_case_content()` hydrates schema v1 and v2 cases.
- Offline migration script added at `scripts/migrate_sop_schema_v2.py` with rollback-safe write ordering and validation/report support.

Current checkpoint:
- Item 17 is frontend-facing. Mockups were created at `docs/superpowers/mockups/2026-05-06-sop-uplift-item17-run-pipeline-mockups.md`.
- Do not edit `kpmg_ui/client/src/pages/sop-uplift.tsx` for Item 17 until the human reviews those mockups.

---

## 17. Document Uplift Item 28 Settings Controls - 2026-05-06

Implemented Item 28 from `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-05-sop-uplift-scale-quality-plan.md`.

Key changes:
- Added `GET /settings/document-uplift-config` and `POST /settings/document-uplift-config` in `api/routers/settings.py`.
- The endpoints use the existing MongoDB-backed `utils.llm_config_store` Document Uplift budget config helpers seeded by `MAX_LLM_CALLS_PER_PIPELINE`.
- Added the Settings page card "Document Uplift Pipeline Controls" below the existing LLM Provider card, without replacing LLM Provider, LLM Model, context upload, or Navigation Visibility.
- Added frontend source coverage in `kpmg_ui/client/src/pages/settings.document-uplift-config.test.ts`.

Verification:
- `python -m pytest tests\test_settings.py tests\test_document_uplift_api.py -v` passed.
- `node --import tsx .\client\src\pages\settings.document-uplift-config.test.ts` passed.
- `npm run check` and `npm run build` passed.

Current checkpoint:
- Item 29 mockups were approved and Item 29 was implemented; see section 18 below.

---

## 18. Document Uplift Item 29 Frontend Page - 2026-05-06

Implemented Item 29 from `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-05-sop-uplift-scale-quality-plan.md` after human approval of the Item 29 mockups.

Key changes:
- Added `/document-uplift` route in `kpmg_ui/client/src/App.tsx`.
- Added a new Document Uplift sidebar entry with `NEW` badge in `kpmg_ui/client/src/components/AppLayout.tsx`.
- Kept SOP Uplift visible, with a tooltip noting it is superseded by Document Uplift.
- Added `kpmg_ui/client/src/pages/document-uplift.tsx` with case explorer/create, upload and tag workflow, pipeline run/generate controls, suggestion queue, document review/edit/reject/accept actions, source references, generated outputs, cost badge, reject-all confirmation, and auto-accepted warning display.
- Added source coverage in `kpmg_ui/client/src/document-uplift.item29.test.ts`.

Verification:
- `node --import tsx .\client\src\document-uplift.item29.test.ts` passed.
- `npm run check` passed.
- `npm run build` passed with existing PostCSS `from` and large chunk warnings.

Current checkpoint:
- Item 29 is complete.
- Next plan item is Item 30: add the Document Uplift SSE endpoint and wire `EventSource` in `document-uplift.tsx` for live progress updates.

---

## 19. Document Uplift Item 30 SSE Progress - 2026-05-06

Implemented Item 30 from `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-05-sop-uplift-scale-quality-plan.md`.

Key changes:
- Added `GET /document-uplift/cases/{case_id}/pipeline/stream` in `api/routers/document_uplift.py`.
- The stream uses `utils.sop_processing.sse_events.yield_sse_event()` and emits `stage`, `progress`, `complete`, and `error` events from persisted case state.
- Wired `EventSource` in `kpmg_ui/client/src/pages/document-uplift.tsx`.
- The UI maps SSE `step` values to readable labels and updates the pipeline progress bar; existing polling/refetch remains as fallback.
- Added backend and frontend coverage in `tests/test_document_uplift_api.py` and `kpmg_ui/client/src/document-uplift.item30.test.ts`.

Verification:
- `python -m pytest tests\test_document_uplift_api.py -v` passed.
- `node --import tsx .\client\src\document-uplift.item29.test.ts` passed.
- `node --import tsx .\client\src\document-uplift.item30.test.ts` passed.
- `npm run check` and `npm run build` passed.

Current checkpoint:
- Items 29 and 30 are complete.
- Next plan item is Item 31: cross-document data-flow integration test before Checkpoint C.

---

## 20. Document Uplift Item 31 Cross-Document Data Flow - 2026-05-06

Implemented Item 31 from `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-05-sop-uplift-scale-quality-plan.md`.

Key changes:
- Added `tests/test_document_uplift_pipeline.py::test_cross_document_corpus_map_flows_from_excel_to_analysis`.
- The test runs Stage 1 with a real in-memory Excel RCM through `utils.services.excel_pipeline` and real `utils.services.analysis` flow, with deterministic mocked LLM responses.
- `AnalysisResult` now carries optional `corpus_map`.
- `utils/services/analysis.py` derives `sop_to_control_map` from process steps that include `anchor_id` and control identifiers.
- `utils/sop_processing/pipeline.py` persists both Excel-derived risk/evidence mappings and analysis-derived SOP/control mappings into the case `corpus_map`.

Verification:
- `python -m pytest tests\test_document_uplift_pipeline.py -v` passed.
- `python -m pytest tests\services\test_analysis.py tests\services\test_excel_pipeline.py -v` passed.
- `python -m pytest tests\test_document_uplift_api.py -v` passed.

Current checkpoint:
- Item 31 is complete.
- Next plan step is CHECKPOINT C. This requires an end-to-end local run plus manual verification that Word track-changes opens in Word 365, diagrams render, cost badge is correct, Mongo case document stays under 500KB, and TC-05 cross-document suggestion is present.

---

## 21. Document Uplift Checkpoint C Automated Verification - 2026-05-07

Completed the automated/runtime portions of CHECKPOINT C from `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-05-sop-uplift-scale-quality-plan.md`.

Key changes verified:
- Rebuilt and recreated `fastapi_api` and `web_ui_agent` with `DOCUMENT_UPLIFT_ENABLED=true`.
- Reran Stage 1 and Stage 2 on live case `fa7cd113-19d0-4505-b565-cd88ea1835c2`.
- Stage 1 persisted `stage1_cost.call_count = 13`.
- Stage 2 persisted `final_cost.call_count = 19` for `gemini-3-flash-preview`.
- Live case has 6 suggestions, including 5 cross-document `mapping_gap` suggestions with both SOP and RCM source references.
- Generated outputs are stored in GridFS and downloadable through `GET /document-uplift/cases/{case_id}/outputs/{output_id}`.
- Direct Mongo BSON size check for the case document is 28,436 bytes, below the 500KB T3 target.

Verification:
- `python -m pytest tests\services\test_analysis.py tests\services\test_excel_pipeline.py tests\sop_processing\test_output_generator.py tests\test_document_uplift_api.py tests\test_document_uplift_pipeline.py tests\test_settings.py -v` passed: 70 passed.
- `node --import tsx .\client\src\document-uplift.item29.test.ts` passed.
- `node --import tsx .\client\src\document-uplift.item30.test.ts` passed.
- `node --import tsx .\client\src\pages\settings.document-uplift-config.test.ts` passed.
- `npm run check` passed.
- `npm run build` passed with existing PostCSS `from` and large chunk warnings.
- Download endpoint returned HTTP 200 for all outputs: DOCX 18,977 bytes, PNG 507,291 bytes, PDF 32,249 bytes.
- GridFS inspection found valid PNG/PDF signatures and DOCX `word/document.xml`, `word/comments.xml`, `w:ins`, and rationale comments.

Remaining gates:
- Manual Word 365 review of the downloaded DOCX is still required. The live DOCX has insertions and rationale comments; it has no `w:del` because the live accepted suggestions are additive mapping-gap insertions. Replacement/deletion markup is covered by `tests/sop_processing/test_output_generator.py`.
- T8 human usefulness review is still required: randomly sample 3 suggestions and rate at least 2 as useful before permanently enabling the feature flag.
- After those gates, next implementation item is Item 32: Celery + Redis Docker Compose wiring.

---

## 22. Document Uplift Word 365 Review Remediation - 2026-05-07

Addressed Word review feedback on the generated DOCX for case `fa7cd113-19d0-4505-b565-cd88ea1835c2`.

Key changes:
- DOCX changes are no longer appended with `Suggested addition:` fallback text.
- Output placement now uses explicit `target_anchor_id`, best matching extracted process step, fuzzy matching against actual SOP paragraphs, and only then weak source-anchor fallback.
- Tiny header/table fragments such as `Date` are no longer accepted as edit anchors.
- LLM rewrite output is cleaned so Markdown headings and label blocks do not leak into Word.
- Comments no longer expose internal anchor IDs.
- Comments resolve uploaded source filenames from case document tags, so older saved suggestions show source documents such as `WM_Client_Onboarding_KYC_SOP_v3.1.docx` and `WM_Risk_Controls_Matrix.xlsx - Risk Control Matrix row 13` instead of UUID-like file IDs.
- Non-RCM/non-control placement is covered by regression tests using incident/evidence-style source examples.

Verification:
- `python -m pytest tests\sop_processing\test_output_generator.py -q` passed: 11 passed.
- `python -m pytest tests\test_document_uplift_api.py tests\test_document_uplift_pipeline.py tests\test_document_uplift_infrastructure.py -q` passed: 29 passed.
- FastAPI was rebuilt and recreated with `DOCUMENT_UPLIFT_ENABLED=true` and `TASK_BACKEND=asyncio`.
- Stage 2 was regenerated for live case `fa7cd113-19d0-4505-b565-cd88ea1835c2`.
- Downloaded DOCX inspection found 5 comments, 5 insertions, 1 deletion, no anchor wording, no internal file UUIDs, no `Suggested addition`, and no Markdown `###` headings.

Current checkpoint:
- The technical remediation for the Word review feedback is implemented and live in the local FastAPI container.
- Human Word 365 visual review is still required for final acceptance.
- T8 and T9 human usefulness gates remain pending before the original Document Uplift plan can be considered fully complete.

Known unrelated test note:
- A full-suite `python -m pytest tests/ -q` run earlier reported 353 passed and 4 unrelated failures in legacy regulatory comparison/settings tests that were not touched by this remediation.

---

## 23. Document Uplift Holistic Edit Targets - 2026-05-07

Implemented the generic fix for coordinated uplift suggestions after Word 365 review showed that a source/control statement could be inserted into a role cell as if every finding were a single paragraph edit.

Key changes:
- Added `SuggestionEditTarget` and `Suggestion.edit_targets` to the Document Uplift schema.
- A single suggestion can now carry multiple target edits, such as `procedure_step` and `role_responsibility`.
- Cross-document mapping-gap fallback emits procedure and responsibility targets when the uploaded SOP has a responsibility/RACI-like area.
- Output generation flattens accepted targets into separate tracked Word changes with separate comments and target anchors/text.
- Target prose is generated as SOP-native role/activity language; source/control IDs stay in suggestion title, rationale, and source references.
- Document Uplift UI renders bundled suggestions under `Uplift Targets` and hides internal anchors from source labels.

Verification:
- `python -m pytest tests/services/test_schemas.py tests/services/test_analysis.py tests/sop_processing/test_output_generator.py -q` passed: 32 passed.
- `python -m pytest tests/sop_processing/test_output_generator.py -q` passed: 12 passed.
- `node --import tsx .\client\src\document-uplift.item29.test.ts` passed after elevated rerun for sandbox `tsx` spawn permissions.
- `node --import tsx .\client\src\document-uplift.severity.test.ts` passed.
- `npm run check` passed.
- `docker compose build fastapi_api web_ui_agent` passed with existing Vite/PostCSS/chunk warnings.
- `DOCUMENT_UPLIFT_ENABLED=true TASK_BACKEND=asyncio docker compose up -d --force-recreate fastapi_api web_ui_agent` completed; both containers are healthy.
- `GET http://localhost:5000/api/document-uplift/cases` returned cases, confirming the local feature flag is enabled.

Current checkpoint:
- New analysis runs can create holistic edit bundles.
- Existing Mongo suggestions created before this change do not contain `edit_targets`; rerun analysis is needed before the sample case will demonstrate coordinated procedure/responsibility output.
- Target-level editing is not implemented yet; bundled suggestions are accepted/rejected as a whole for now.

Remaining gates:
- Rerun a live sample case and manually review the fresh DOCX in Word 365.
- Complete T8 human usefulness review and T9 cross-domain usefulness review.

---

## 24. Document Uplift Document-Aware Output Compiler - 2026-05-07

Implemented the generic document-aware Word output remediation after review showed that responsibility updates could land in the wrong structural location or read like copied control text.

Key changes:
- Stage 2 output now treats `role_responsibility` targets as document-aware edits.
- Existing role/responsibility tables are detected by semantic header labels, and insertions go into the responsibility column instead of the role-name column.
- Bullet/prose responsibility areas such as `Role: responsibility` are also supported, so the implementation is not table-only.
- Fallback paragraph matching now skips role-name cells to avoid corrupting RACI/role tables.
- Responsibility text is condensed into active-voice, document-native language and strips retained-evidence material from role responsibility cells.
- Numbered headings pasted into proposed text, including colon headings such as `5.2 Access Review Process: ...`, are stripped before insertion.
- Comments use the parent suggestion title and human-readable source document labels, without internal anchor IDs.
- A domain-neutral design addendum was added at `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-07-document-uplift-document-aware-output-compiler-design.md`.

Verification:
- `python -m pytest tests\sop_processing\test_document_aware_output_compiler.py -q` passed: 7 passed.
- `python -m pytest tests\services\test_schemas.py tests\services\test_analysis.py tests\sop_processing\test_output_generator.py tests\sop_processing\test_document_aware_output_compiler.py -q` passed: 39 passed.
- `docker compose build fastapi_api` passed.
- FastAPI was recreated with `DOCUMENT_UPLIFT_ENABLED=true` and `TASK_BACKEND=asyncio`.
- Live Stage 2 generation for case `fa7cd113-19d0-4505-b565-cd88ea1835c2` completed with Gemini `gemini-3-flash-preview`, final `call_count=36`.
- Final generated DOCX downloaded to `output/doc/fa7cd113-19d0-4505-b565-cd88ea1835c2-uplifted-sop-document-aware-v4.docx`.
- DOCX package inspection found: 22 tracked insertions, 0 role-name-cell insertions, 6 responsibility-cell insertions, no retained-evidence blobs in role responsibilities, no generic comment prefixes, no `anchor` wording in comments, and no duplicate numbered-heading insertions.

Current checkpoint:
- Technical remediation is implemented and live in the local FastAPI container.
- The final review artifact is `output/doc/fa7cd113-19d0-4505-b565-cd88ea1835c2-uplifted-sop-document-aware-v4.docx`.
- LibreOffice/Poppler render tools were not available in the shell, so visual pagination/layout still needs Word 365 review.

Remaining gates:
- Human Word 365 visual review of the final DOCX.
- T8 usefulness review.
- T9 cross-domain usefulness review.

---

## 25. Document Uplift Reference Placement + Orthogonal Flowcharts - 2026-05-07

Addressed a Word review issue where a procedure update anchored inside a reference document table, and replaced the simple swimlane renderer with a more standard orthogonal swimlane output.

Key changes:
- Non-metadata procedure updates no longer anchor inside reference/catalog/library tables.
- Diagram generation now uses the current reviewed SOP state: accepted/edited suggestions are included in the generated SOP text; rejected/pending suggestions are excluded; if zero suggestions are accepted, the diagram is generated from the as-is SOP.
- The swimlane prompt explicitly states that rejected/pending suggestions must not be inferred.
- Flowchart connectors are routed as Manhattan paths with only horizontal/vertical segments.
- The renderer now includes KPMG/TRACE-style header, dark lane labels, standard shape legend, footer panels, and lane colour summary.
- No swimlane names or process steps are hardcoded; lanes and nodes still come from the extracted `SwimlaneSpec`.

Verification:
- `python -m pytest tests\sop_processing\test_document_aware_output_compiler.py -q` passed: 8 passed.
- `python -m pytest tests\services\test_diagram_renderer.py -q` passed: 7 passed.
- `python -m pytest tests\test_prompts.py tests\services\test_diagram_renderer.py tests\services\test_schemas.py tests\services\test_analysis.py tests\sop_processing\test_output_generator.py tests\sop_processing\test_document_aware_output_compiler.py -q` passed: 53 passed.
- `docker compose build fastapi_api` passed.
- FastAPI was recreated with `DOCUMENT_UPLIFT_ENABLED=true` and `TASK_BACKEND=asyncio`.
- Live Stage 2 generation for case `fa7cd113-19d0-4505-b565-cd88ea1835c2` completed with final `call_count=36`.
- Final review artifacts:
  - `output/doc/fa7cd113-19d0-4505-b565-cd88ea1835c2-uplifted-sop-document-aware-v7.docx`
  - `output/doc/fa7cd113-19d0-4505-b565-cd88ea1835c2-swimlane-v7.png`
  - `output/doc/fa7cd113-19d0-4505-b565-cd88ea1835c2-swimlane-v7.pdf`
- Final DOCX XML inspection found 22 tracked insertions, 0 reference-table insertions, 0 role-name-cell insertions, no generic comment prefixes, and no `anchor` wording in comments.
- Flowchart artifact checks found a valid PNG at 6368 x 2729 and a valid PDF signature.

Remaining gates:
- Human review of the v7 DOCX and flowchart artifacts.
- T8 usefulness review.
- T9 cross-domain usefulness review, including the planned Cyber and ESG document packs.

---

## 26. Document Uplift Flowchart Styling + Metadata - 2026-05-08

Tightened the generic swimlane renderer after visual review feedback on standard flowchart appearance, line routing, and missing document filename.

Key changes:
- `SwimlaneSpec` now supports optional `process_owner` and `document_name` metadata.
- Swimlane extraction asks for owner/document metadata when it is explicitly present.
- Stage 2 fills missing diagram document metadata from the primary uploaded procedure/process/policy filename in the case document tags.
- Stage 2 fills a missing process owner from the first extracted swimlane when the LLM omits owner metadata.
- Renderer shape styling now uses navy process boxes, teal decision diamonds, oval start/end terminals, stronger lane dividers, wrapped lane footer labels, and standard shape legend symbols.
- Connector routing uses shape-specific edge anchors, decision branches exit from different vertices, and stored connector points are asserted to be only horizontal/vertical.
- No swimlanes, process steps, KYC labels, RCM labels, or source-specific control names are hardcoded.

Verification:
- `python -m pytest tests\services\test_diagram_renderer.py -q` passed: 13 passed.
- `python -m pytest tests\sop_processing\test_output_generator.py::test_generate_outputs_uses_primary_procedure_filename_in_swimlane_metadata -q` passed.
- `python -m pytest tests\test_prompts.py tests\services\test_diagram_renderer.py tests\services\test_schemas.py tests\services\test_analysis.py tests\sop_processing\test_output_generator.py tests\sop_processing\test_document_aware_output_compiler.py -q` passed: 60 passed.
- `git diff --check` passed for the modified files.
- `docker compose build fastapi_api` passed.
- FastAPI was recreated with `DOCUMENT_UPLIFT_ENABLED=true` and `TASK_BACKEND=asyncio`.
- Live Stage 2 generation for case `fa7cd113-19d0-4505-b565-cd88ea1835c2` completed.
- Final DOCX inspection found 30 tracked insertions, 12 tracked deletions, 22 comments, no `anchor` wording, no UUID-like source IDs in comments, and source document labels present.
- PNG/PDF checks passed: valid PNG at 7364 x 3120 and valid PDF signature.

Current review artifacts:
- `output/doc/fa7cd113-19d0-4505-b565-cd88ea1835c2-uplifted-sop-document-aware-v9.docx`
- `output/doc/fa7cd113-19d0-4505-b565-cd88ea1835c2-swimlane-v9.png`
- `output/doc/fa7cd113-19d0-4505-b565-cd88ea1835c2-swimlane-v9.pdf`

Remaining gates:
- Human Word 365 visual review of v9 DOCX.
- Human flowchart design review of v9 PNG/PDF.
- T8 usefulness review.
- T9 cross-domain usefulness review with Cyber and ESG document packs.

## 27. Document Uplift T9 Cyber/ESG Validation - 2026-05-08

Ran the Cyber and ESG validation packs through the live Document Uplift pipeline.

Validation cases:
- Cybersecurity: `cd10c25f-66a9-4628-99a2-7003949e2c9c`
- ESG / Sustainability: `fa6e0b67-22e8-410c-a4f4-7e7ac191f454`

Generated artifacts:
- `output/doc/cyber-t9-docx.docx`
- `output/doc/cyber-t9-png_diagram.png`
- `output/doc/cyber-t9-pdf_diagram.pdf`
- `output/doc/esg-t9-docx.docx`
- `output/doc/esg-t9-png_diagram.png`
- `output/doc/esg-t9-pdf_diagram.pdf`
- `output/doc/cyber-esg-t9-validation-comparison.md`

Validation result:
- Cyber generated 21 suggestions and is a partial cross-domain pass.
- ESG generated 5 suggestions and does not yet pass the cross-domain usefulness gate.
- Cyber gaps: severity taxonomy, evidence chain-of-custody, internal escalation SLA, external contact list, formal review cycle, and event-log-derived issues were not detected strongly enough.
- ESG gaps: the RCM and metric deviation log were not mined into specific uplift suggestions; the engine mostly produced broad SOP-quality suggestions.
- One blank Cyber suggestion was persisted and needs a quality filter.
- Several LLM-generated process suggestions lack source document labels, while deterministic mapping-gap suggestions do cite uploaded source filenames.

Recommended next implementation slice:
- Add a generic `DocumentIssueSignal` extraction pass across every uploaded document role and format.
- Use it for event logs, deviation logs, control assessments, issue/action trackers, and unstructured text.
- Group extracted signals into domain-neutral finding patterns before generating SOP-targeted suggestions.
- Add regression tests for Cyber event-log recurrence/SLA findings, Cyber chain-of-custody gaps, ESG metric deviations, ESG RCM control-assessment exceptions, no blank persisted suggestions, and mandatory human-readable source document labels.

Remaining gates:
- T9 Cyber/ESG regression fixes and tests.
- Human review of the Cyber/ESG generated DOCX and flowchart artifacts.

## 28. Document Uplift T9 Fresh Cyber/ESG Rerun - 2026-05-08

Implemented the generic supporting-document signal pass and reran the fresh Cyber/ESG files from `output/doc/Cyber and ESG files`.

Key changes:
- Generic `DocumentIssueSignal` extraction now runs across complete structured sheets, not only RCM-like sheets.
- Metric-deviation routing now requires measurement context, preventing control assessment action rows from being mislabeled as metric deviations.
- Open issue dependencies are generated from generic gap/action/status rows across domains.
- Blank/material-less LLM suggestions are filtered before persistence.
- Stage 2 output generation now respects `DOCUMENT_UPLIFT_STAGE2_REWRITE_LIMIT` (default `12`) so large accepted suggestion batches complete predictably.

Final validation cases:
- Cybersecurity: `79a2fe76-b8cb-4c1f-912a-28194b6d4650`
- ESG / Sustainability: `7f32586e-3c3f-4ecd-ba36-973121213d5d`

Generated artifacts:
- `output/doc/cyber-fresh-final-t9-docx.docx`
- `output/doc/cyber-fresh-final-t9-swimlane.png`
- `output/doc/cyber-fresh-final-t9-swimlane.pdf`

- `output/doc/esg-fresh-final-t9-case.json`
- `output/doc/cyber-esg-fresh-final-t9-validation-comparison.md`

Validation result:
- Cyber generated 39 suggestions: 23 process improvements, 12 mapping gaps, 4 ownership conflicts.
- ESG generated 35 process improvement suggestions.
- Cyber sources include `cyber_rcm.xlsx`, `cyber_risk_event_log.xlsx`, and `cyber_ir_sop.docx`.
- ESG sources include `esg_rcm.xlsx`, `esg_metric_deviation_log.xlsx`, and `esg_reporting_sop.docx`.
- Cyber DOCX sanity check: 51 comments, 51 tracked insertions, 6 tracked deletions; swimlane PNG 5460 x 2985.
- ESG DOCX sanity check: 35 comments, 35 tracked insertions, 3 tracked deletions; swimlane PNG 5910 x 2580.

Verification:
- `python -m pytest tests\services\test_generic_findings.py tests\services\test_excel_pipeline.py tests\services\test_analysis.py -q` passed: 34 passed.
- `python -m pytest tests\services\test_generic_findings.py tests\services\test_excel_pipeline.py tests\services\test_analysis.py tests\sop_processing\test_output_generator.py tests\sop_processing\test_document_aware_output_compiler.py -q` passed: 56 passed.
- `docker compose build fastapi_api` passed.
- FastAPI was recreated with `DOCUMENT_UPLIFT_ENABLED=true` and `TASK_BACKEND=asyncio`.

Current checkpoint:
- T9 behavior is materially improved for Cyber and ESG supporting documents.
- The suggestion queue is prioritized/deduped by design; it is not a full issue-register export.
- The local API is running with Document Uplift enabled.

Remaining gates:
- Human review of final Cyber/ESG Word outputs and swimlane diagrams.
- Later UI restructure for Document Uplift review flow.
- Optional future issue-register extraction mode if every evidence row must be exported.

## 29. Document Uplift Structural Completeness + Role/RACI Guard - 2026-05-08

Completed the follow-up slice for missing SOP structures and senior-role responsibility quality.

Key changes:
- Added a generic structural completeness pass in `utils/services/structural_completeness.py`.
- Added a generic role assignment guard in `utils/services/role_assignment_guard.py`.
- Integrated both into `utils/services/analysis.py`.
- Added regression tests in `tests/services/test_analysis.py`.
- Changed local Docker Compose defaults so `DOCUMENT_UPLIFT_ENABLED` defaults to `true` for FastAPI/Celery services, while preserving explicit `DOCUMENT_UPLIFT_ENABLED=false` override support.

What the structural pass detects generically:
- Missing accountability/RACI matrix when multi-role activity or handoff signals exist.
- Referenced levels/categories without classification criteria.
- Escalation/notification language with vague timing.
- Event/remediation processes without post-event review or closure control.
- Missing document owner/version/review metadata in substantive process documents.
- Supporting obligations/frameworks without an obligation calendar.
- Metrics/targets without a metric owner/source/validator/deadline matrix.
- Risk/threshold signals without risk appetite or tolerance linkage.

Role/RACI guard:
- Prevents senior oversight roles such as CISO, chief roles, board, committees, and executive roles from being turned into hands-on operational owners when the proposed activity is operational.
- Keeps the procedure update operational-role oriented and routes responsibility-area changes to `raci_matrix`.
- This is role-signal and action-signal based, not Cyber/KYC/ESG specific.

Validation cases:
- Cyber: `cfe2acd7-e656-41cc-be05-80dca0565b74`, 44 suggestions, Stage 2 complete.
- ESG: `96d0e5a1-4722-4ab6-bc81-48df8d761334`, 44 suggestions, Stage 2 complete.

Generated review artifacts:
- `output/doc/cyber-structural-completeness-docx.docx`
- `output/doc/cyber-structural-completeness-swimlane.png`
- `output/doc/cyber-structural-completeness-swimlane.pdf`
- `output/doc/esg-structural-completeness-docx.docx`

- `output/doc/esg-structural-completeness-swimlane.pdf`
- `output/doc/cyber-esg-structural-completeness-validation-comparison.md`

Verification:
- Targeted paused tests passed: 3 passed.
- `python -m pytest tests\services\test_analysis.py tests\services\test_generic_findings.py tests\services\test_excel_pipeline.py -q` passed: 37 passed.
- `python -m pytest tests\services\test_analysis.py tests\services\test_generic_findings.py tests\services\test_excel_pipeline.py tests\sop_processing\test_output_generator.py tests\sop_processing\test_document_aware_output_compiler.py -q` passed: 59 passed.
- `docker compose build fastapi_api` passed.
- `docker compose config --quiet` passed.
- FastAPI was recreated and is healthy with Document Uplift enabled.
- DOCX/PNG sanity checks passed:
  - Cyber: 56 comments, 66 tracked insertions, 8 tracked deletions, PNG 7710 x 2175.
  - ESG: 44 comments, 54 tracked insertions, 8 tracked deletions, PNG 9060 x 2580.
- Unsafe senior-role text scan found no `CISO performs`, `Chief ... performs`, `Chief ... investigate`, or `performs investigate` matches in the generated suggestion JSON.

Ground-truth comparison:
- Cyber now covers RACI/accountability, severity/classification criteria, escalation timing, regulatory obligation calendar, post-event review, document control, and diagram output.
- ESG now covers deviation thresholds, regulatory calendar, metric/data owner matrix, escalation timeframes, cadence, assurance interaction, risk appetite linkage, and data-quality validation.
- Remaining partial gaps are intentionally logged in `output/doc/cyber-esg-structural-completeness-validation-comparison.md`: specialized playbook matrices, evidence preservation/chain-of-custody, oversight committee reporting cadence, and category-universe coverage such as all Scope 3 categories.

Remaining gates:
- Human review of the new Cyber/ESG DOCX and swimlane artifacts.
- Next implementation slice, if approved: add the four remaining generic structural patterns without hardcoding Cyber, ESG, KYC, RCM, or any specific domain.

---

## 30. Document Uplift Structural Output Formatting Guard - 2026-05-08

Implemented the generic formatting guard for structural suggestions after review showed that RACI-style recommendations could be inserted into Word as raw markdown.

Key changes:
- Added `requires_explicit_review` on structural suggestions.
- Auto-accept and bulk accept now leave those structural suggestions pending unless a reviewer explicitly accepts them.
- Accepted markdown-table suggestions now render as native Word tables in the DOCX output instead of pipe-delimited markdown text.
- The behavior is structure-based and domain-neutral; it is not tied to RACI, Cyber, ESG, KYC, RCM, or a specific document type.

Verification:
- `python -m pytest tests\test_document_uplift_api.py::test_auto_accept_skips_structural_suggestions_requiring_explicit_review tests\test_document_uplift_api.py::test_bulk_review_accept_all_skips_structural_suggestions_requiring_explicit_review tests\sop_processing\test_output_generator.py::test_generate_outputs_formats_markdown_table_targets_as_word_tables -q` passed: 3 passed.

Current behavior:
- Broad structural suggestions remain review-only by default.
- If a reviewer explicitly accepts a table-style structural suggestion, the Word output uses an actual table.
- Older generated DOCX files are unchanged; regenerate outputs to pick up this behavior.

Remaining gates:
- Fresh Cyber/ESG rerun after selecting which structural suggestions should be accepted.
- Later Document Uplift UI restructure so review, source evidence, outputs, and diagrams are not crowded onto one page.

---

## 31. Document Uplift Anchor Distribution + Merge Guard - 2026-05-08

Implemented the next output-quality slice after review identified remaining anchor pile-up and rewrite-budget issues.

Key changes:
- Deterministic mapping-gap fallback now selects the best matching SOP anchor for each missing source/control row instead of sending every procedure update to the first procedural anchor.
- Stage 2 merges same-anchor additive procedure/evidence/monitoring updates before DOCX write, reducing stacked Word Review insertions.
- Markdown-table structural suggestions are excluded from the merge path and still render as native Word tables when explicitly accepted.
- Local review rewrite budget default is now `50`; `DOCUMENT_UPLIFT_STAGE2_REWRITE_LIMIT=-1` remains the unlimited option.
- `docker-compose.yml` passes the rewrite budget to FastAPI and Celery with `DOCUMENT_UPLIFT_STAGE2_REWRITE_LIMIT=${DOCUMENT_UPLIFT_STAGE2_REWRITE_LIMIT:-50}`.

Verification:
- Red tests first reproduced first-anchor routing and same-anchor stacked insertions.
- `python -m pytest tests\services\test_analysis.py::test_mapping_gap_targets_best_matching_procedure_anchor_not_first_anchor tests\sop_processing\test_output_generator.py::test_generate_outputs_merges_same_anchor_procedure_additions -q` passed: 2 passed.
- `python -m pytest tests\services\test_analysis.py tests\services\test_generic_findings.py tests\services\test_excel_pipeline.py tests\sop_processing\test_output_generator.py tests\sop_processing\test_document_aware_output_compiler.py -q` passed: 62 passed.
- `docker compose config --quiet` passed.
- `docker compose build fastapi_api` passed.
- FastAPI was recreated with Document Uplift enabled and is healthy.

Current checkpoint:
- The live local FastAPI container has the anchor distribution, merge guard, and rewrite-budget changes.
- A fresh Cyber/ESG rerun has not yet been captured after this slice.

Remaining gates:
- Rerun Cyber/ESG after confirming reviewer selections.
- Word 365 visual review of the regenerated DOCX files.
- Later Document Uplift UI restructure.

---

## 32. Localhost Port Binding Fix - 2026-05-08

Fixed the local Docker access issue where `http://localhost:5000/` hung while `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` worked.

Root cause:
- Windows resolved `localhost` to IPv6 `::1` first.
- Docker's IPv6 published port path accepted the connection but did not return HTTP data.
- The web UI itself was healthy and responsive on IPv4.

Change:
- Updated `docker-compose.yml` to bind FastAPI and the web UI to IPv4 loopback:
  - `127.0.0.1:8000:8000`
  - `127.0.0.1:5000:5000`
- Recreated `fastapi_api` and `web_ui_agent`.

Verification:
- `docker compose config --quiet` passed.
- `curl.exe -I --max-time 10 http://localhost:5000/` returned `200 OK`.
- `Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing -Uri http://localhost:5000/` returned `200 OK`.
- `Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing -Uri http://localhost:5000/api/health` returned `200 OK`.
- `Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing -Uri http://localhost:8000/health` returned `200 OK`.

Current status:
- `http://localhost:5000/` is working again.
- FastAPI is reachable at `http://localhost:8000/health`.

---

## 33. Document Uplift Remaining Structural Patterns - 2026-05-11

Picked up from `docs/document-uplift-build-log.md` and completed the four generic structural patterns left from the T9 hardening slice.

Key changes:
- Added a response/playbook matrix recommendation when a procedure references multiple event, scenario, case, or exception types without type-specific response steps.
- Added evidence preservation and chain-of-custody recommendations when source material describes collecting or retaining evidence without custody, integrity, retention-location, or transfer controls.
- Added oversight reporting matrix recommendations when board, committee, steering, forum, or oversight reporting is referenced without structured recipient/cadence/content/evidence requirements.
- Added category coverage matrix recommendations when source documents reference category, population, scope, or coverage-universe signals that are not reconciled in the procedure.

Files changed:
- `utils/services/structural_completeness.py`
- `tests/services/test_analysis.py`
- `docs/document-uplift-build-log.md`
- `docs/HANDOFF.md`

Verification:
- Red tests first failed with 4 missing structural suggestions.
- Targeted tests passed: 4 passed.
- Focused regression passed: `python -m pytest tests\services\test_analysis.py tests\services\test_generic_findings.py tests\services\test_excel_pipeline.py tests\sop_processing\test_output_generator.py tests\sop_processing\test_document_aware_output_compiler.py -q` passed: 66 passed.
- `docker compose config --quiet` passed.
- `docker compose build fastapi_api` passed.
- FastAPI was recreated and is healthy at `127.0.0.1:8000`; `/health` returned `200`.

Current status:
- The local FastAPI container is running the expanded structural completeness checks.
- Suggestions remain reviewer-gated through the existing `requires_explicit_review` path.
- The implementation remains generic and does not hardcode Cyber, ESG, KYC, RCM, or specific process names.

Remaining gates:
- Fresh Cyber/ESG rerun with the expanded structural pattern set.
- Human Word 365 review of regenerated DOCX/swimlane outputs.
- T8 and T9 human usefulness review.
- Later Document Uplift UI restructure for a less crowded review flow.

## 34. Gemini Default + Fresh Cyber/ESG Prompt-Hardening Validation - 2026-05-11

Picked up after Claude Code's prompt-hardening changes and completed the fresh Cyber/ESG validation run using Gemini as the persisted active LLM.

Key changes:
- Preserved runtime LLM provider switching while explicitly setting MongoDB `settings.llm_config` to Gemini:
  - `provider = gemini`
  - `model = gemini-3-flash-preview`
- Fixed provider-temperature compatibility for Anthropic Claude 4 models by omitting the `temperature` kwarg for `claude-opus-4*` and `claude-sonnet-4*`.
- Added a small MongoDB database-name resolver in `utils/llm_config_store.py` so provider switching persists against the existing `Trace_db` database even when the code default remains lowercase `trace_db`.

Files changed by this checkpoint:
- `utils/llm_config_store.py`
- `tests/test_settings.py`
- `docs/document-uplift-build-log.md`
- `docs/HANDOFF.md`

Verification:
- `python -m pytest tests\test_settings.py -q` passed: 25 passed.
- Focused regression passed: `python -m pytest tests\test_settings.py tests\test_prompts.py tests\services\test_llm_orchestrator.py tests\services\test_analysis.py tests\services\test_generic_findings.py tests\services\test_excel_pipeline.py tests\sop_processing\test_output_generator.py tests\sop_processing\test_document_aware_output_compiler.py -q` passed: 103 passed.
- Rebuilt and recreated `fastapi_api`; Docker reported it healthy.
- `http://localhost:8000/health` returned `ok`.
- `http://localhost:5000/api/health` returned `ok`.
- `GET /settings/system-status` and `GET /settings/llm-status` both confirmed active Gemini.

Fresh validation cases:
- Cyber: `6e3c4dd2-6981-4072-b267-64ca581de8cd`
  - Stage 1: `review_ready`, 49 suggestions, 11 Gemini calls, no warnings.
  - Stage 2: `complete`, 56 total Gemini calls, 3 outputs.
  - Artifacts:
    - `output/doc/cyber-gemini-uplifted-sop.docx`
    - `output/doc/cyber-gemini-swimlane.png`
    - `output/doc/cyber-gemini-swimlane.pdf`
    - `output/doc/cyber-gemini-case-final.json`
    - `output/doc/cyber-gemini-suggestions-final.json`
  - Artifact sanity: 54 tracked insertions, 10 tracked deletions, 44 comments; PNG 9510 x 2175; PDF header valid.
- ESG: `56f2c0e8-9f06-4a2b-8478-15d85ad13103`
  - Stage 1: `review_ready`, 49 suggestions, 7 Gemini calls, no warnings.
  - Stage 2: `complete`, 46 total Gemini calls, 3 outputs.
  - Artifacts:
    - `output/doc/esg-gemini-uplifted-sop.docx`
    - `output/doc/esg-gemini-swimlane.png`
    - `output/doc/esg-gemini-swimlane.pdf`
    - `output/doc/esg-gemini-case-final.json`
    - `output/doc/esg-gemini-suggestions-final.json`
  - Artifact sanity: 48 tracked insertions, 10 tracked deletions, 38 comments; PNG 7710 x 2175; PDF header valid.

Important quality finding:
- The fresh runs completed technically, but the suggestion quality is not yet acceptable.
- Cyber has 18 generic `Open issue should be reflected in the procedure` suggestions; ESG has 12.
- ESG has 32 Excel-only suggestions with no SOP anchor or edit target; Cyber has 18 unanchored/no-target suggestions.
- The immediate source is deterministic, not only LLM prompt drift:
  - `utils/services/generic_findings.py::_open_issue_findings()` creates the open-issue template.
  - `utils/services/structural_completeness.py` still includes placeholder matrix rows such as `Metric from source documents` and `Category from source documents`.

Recommended next slice:
- Add a suggestion-quality gate for generic deterministic findings before another rerun.
- Keep Excel-only open issues as review queue findings/evidence notes unless they can be mapped to a concrete SOP anchor and rewritten as a specific SOP edit.
- Replace placeholder structural matrix rows with source-derived rows, or keep those structural suggestions pending until reviewer selection.

Open gates:
- Human usefulness review for Cyber/ESG suggestions.
- Word 365 visual review of the generated DOCX outputs.
- Decide the next quality policy for deterministic generic findings before another validation run.

---

## 35. Mapping-Gap Scope Gate + Granularity Guard - 2026-05-11

Implemented the approved mapping-gap relevance filter and output-shape guard for the Document Uplift Cyber/ESG quality issue.

Key changes:
- Deterministic `mapping_gap` suggestions now pass through a domain-neutral SOP scope responsibility gate in `_cross_document_mapping_gap_suggestions`.
- SOP scope is extracted from classified `purpose_scope` anchors and sent into the LLM `cross_document_synthesis_prompt`.
- No-scope cases are fail-soft: suggestions are still emitted, but marked `requires_explicit_review=True`.
- Inferred coverage no longer treats matching owner/team as enough; activity/evidence overlap is required unless a control ID is explicit.
- Cross-cutting audit-trail style controls are allowed through the relevance filter.
- Final filter calibration uses same-anchor responsibility overlap, not domain blacklists. A production grep found no Cyber/ESG/SWIFT/DLP/fraud/RBI/mobile/CSPM/vendor-management/control-ID exclusions in the changed production files.
- Deterministic `open_issue_dependency` suggestions from `generic_findings.py` are reviewer-gated.
- Stage 2 additive insertions now compact copied numbered sub-procedures into one SOP-appropriate sentence when rewrite is unavailable or unsafe.

Files changed:
- `utils/services/analysis.py`
- `utils/sop_processing/prompts.py`
- `utils/services/generic_findings.py`
- `utils/sop_processing/output_generator.py`
- `tests/services/test_analysis.py`
- `tests/services/test_generic_findings.py`
- `tests/sop_processing/test_output_generator.py`
- `docs/superpowers/plans/mapping-gap-relevance-filter.md`
- `docs/document-uplift-build-log.md`
- `docs/HANDOFF.md`

Verification:
- Domain-focused tests passed, including Cyber, ESG, Vendor Management, no-scope, and cross-cutting audit-trail cases.
- Focused regression passed after final calibration: `python -m pytest tests\services\test_analysis.py tests\services\test_generic_findings.py tests\services\test_excel_pipeline.py tests\sop_processing\test_output_generator.py tests\sop_processing\test_document_aware_output_compiler.py tests\test_prompts.py -q` passed: 81 passed.
- FastAPI was rebuilt/recreated and is healthy at `127.0.0.1:8000`; `/health` returned `200`.

Current status:
- Code and tests are green locally.
- FastAPI is running the latest rebuilt code.
- An intermediate Cyber rerun before the final same-anchor calibration reached `review_ready` with 39 suggestions and 7 mapping gaps; mapping gaps had zero SWIFT/DLP/mobile/fraud/RBI/CSPM hits.
- Final Cyber/ESG Gemini reruns still need to be repeated on the latest rebuilt container.

Next recommended step:
- Rerun the Cyber and ESG cases. Check that Cyber drops SWIFT/DLP/mobile/fraud/RBI self-assessment mapping gaps and ESG retains LTIFR/board metric references only at SOP-step granularity.

Final validation update:
- Cyber final case `00555b2b-1e3c-4738-9228-b3414463258d`
  - Stage 1 `review_ready`: 39 suggestions, 2 mapping gaps, 18 open-issue notes, 28 reviewer-gated.
  - Cyber mapping gaps had zero bad-domain hits for SWIFT, DLP, mobile, fraud, transaction monitoring, RBI/self-assessment, CSPM, payments, and Data Loss Prevention.
  - Stage 2 `complete`: 3 outputs, 23 total Gemini calls.
  - Downloaded artifacts under `output/doc/cyber-scopegate-final2-*`.
  - DOCX sanity: 22 insertions, 12 deletions, 12 comments; no numbered sub-procedure markers.
- ESG final case `b8805497-244f-4b98-9305-31f1b1f68ac3`
  - Stage 1 `review_ready`: 48 suggestions, 0 mapping gaps, 12 open-issue notes, 23 reviewer-gated.
  - ESG sub-procedure marker check had zero hits for `4.2.1`, `4.2.2`, `4.2.3`, `Escalation Protocol`, `Remediation and Evidencing`, `Management of Lost Time Injury`, and `Independent Director Composition`.
  - Stage 2 `complete`: 3 outputs, 34 total Gemini calls.
  - Downloaded artifacts under `output/doc/esg-scopegate-final2-*`.
  - DOCX sanity: 35 insertions, 8 deletions, 25 comments; no numbered sub-procedure markers.
- Timing from stored case timestamps:
  - Cyber Stage 1 wall-clock from case creation to `review_ready`: about 1 min 58 sec.
  - ESG Stage 1 wall-clock from case creation to `review_ready`: about 2 min 02 sec.

Remaining follow-up:
- Human review the generated DOCX files in Word 365.
- Later cleanup: reviewer-gated open-issue notes still contain cross-domain source facts. They are not auto-applied, but the review UI may need a separate evidence-note treatment.

---

## 36. DOCX Placement And Additive Prose Quality Tightening - 2026-05-11

Implemented the follow-up quality fixes from the Cyber/ESG DOCX review. The changes remain domain-agnostic and do not hardcode Cyber, ESG, SWIFT, DLP, Board Independence, LTIFR, or similar domain labels.

Key changes:
- RCM-derived mapping-gap prose now preserves useful leading verbs such as `reviews` and `monitors`, drops weak `performs` wrappers, converts state phrases like `EDR deployed` into `ensures that EDR is deployed`, suppresses placeholder evidence clauses, and preserves acronym casing such as `FSISAC`.
- Mapping-gap fallback no longer creates `role_responsibility` edit targets for every plain control row. It creates role/responsibility targets only when the source row explicitly contains responsibility/accountability language, or when a senior oversight role is assigned operational work and should be routed to RACI by the existing guard.
- Senior-role operational targets still route to `raci_matrix` rather than direct operational responsibilities.
- Structural completeness now treats `if needed`, `if required`, `if necessary`, `as needed`, `as required`, `when necessary`, and `where necessary` as vague escalation timing that requires defined triggers/timeframes.
- Stage 2 detects short unnumbered embedded mini-procedures by structure, not domain terms, and compacts them into a single SOP-appropriate sentence.
- Stage 2 heading placement now compares underlying Word XML paragraph identity, so additions targeted at a heading are inserted after the last body paragraph in that section.
- Role/responsibility table placement remains structural: contact/directories are skipped because their candidate responsibility column cells are short, while true responsibilities tables have descriptive cells.

Files changed in this checkpoint:
- `utils/services/analysis.py`
- `utils/services/role_assignment_guard.py`
- `utils/services/structural_completeness.py`
- `utils/sop_processing/output_generator.py`
- `tests/services/test_analysis.py`
- `tests/sop_processing/test_output_generator.py`
- `docs/document-uplift-build-log.md`
- `docs/HANDOFF.md`

Verification:
- New focused regression passed: 7 passed for RCM prose, role target gating, vague escalation, contact-table placement, heading-section placement, and unnumbered sub-procedure compaction.
- Full affected document-uplift Python tests passed: `python -m pytest tests/services/test_analysis.py tests/sop_processing/test_output_generator.py -q` passed: 52 passed, existing warnings only.
- Broader service tests passed: `python -m pytest tests/services -q` passed: 100 passed, existing pydantic warning only.
- `docker compose build fastapi_api` passed.
- `docker compose up -d --force-recreate fastapi_api` passed.
- `docker compose ps fastapi_api` reported `Up ... (healthy)`.
- `GET http://localhost:8000/health` returned `200`.

Next recommended step:
- Rerun Cyber/ESG on the rebuilt API. Inspect the generated DOCX tracked insertions for:
  - no `performs endpoint...` raw RCM phrasing;
  - no `Retained evidence includes the relevant evidence`;
  - no `fSISAC`;
  - no insertions directly under section headings when that section already has body text;
  - no role/responsibility insertions inside contact lists;
  - no unnumbered mini-procedures such as identification/escalation/remediation blocks.

Validation update:
- Cyber qualityfix case `2f62929c-7df1-46a2-837e-99e235a50d3a` completed after resuming the interrupted run.
  - 39 suggestions, 2 mapping gaps, 28 reviewer-gated.
  - DOCX: 10 tracked insertions, 7 deletions, 10 comments.
  - Scan found zero hits for `performs endpoint`, `Retained evidence includes the relevant evidence`, `fSISAC`, `Identification and Thresholding`, inline `Escalation The`, and inline `Remediation The`.
  - Structure scan found no contact-table insertions and no heading-adjacent insertion where body text follows.
- ESG qualityfix case `d64604c4-c7e2-43d2-bfff-d356d74b0936` completed fresh.
  - 48 suggestions, 0 mapping gaps, 23 reviewer-gated.
  - DOCX: 25 tracked insertions, 4 deletions, 25 comments.
  - Scan found zero hits for the same raw-prose/subprocedure markers and no heading-adjacent insertion pattern.
- Output artifacts and validation summaries are under `output/doc/qualityfix-*`.

Remaining follow-up:
- Human review of the latest Cyber/ESG DOCX outputs in Word 365 is confirmed complete as of 2026-05-11.
- T8 and T9 usefulness gates are confirmed complete as of 2026-05-11.
- T4 restart/retry reliability is confirmed: a seeded stale `analyzing` case survived FastAPI recreation, was marked `failed` with `Document Uplift pipeline stale for more than 3600 seconds`, and then re-triggered to `review_ready`.
- Redis/Celery closeout is confirmed: Redis is healthy and returns `PONG`; Celery worker is online over Redis and declares the `document_uplift`, `conversion`, `chunking`, `excel`, `llm`, `analysis`, and `outputs` queues.
- Final architecture/components/process reference is complete at `docs/document-uplift-architecture.md`.

## 37. Document Uplift Detail UI Fit Fix - 2026-05-11

Implemented the follow-up UI fit fixes for the redesigned Document Uplift case workspace. This is a frontend-only layout/interaction pass except for verifying the existing read-only preview endpoint; no suggestion generation, SOP processing, or document output engine logic was changed.

Key changes:
- Replaced the oversized case-detail hero with the compact TRACE nav plus a slim case status header, so Documents, Processing, Review Suggestions, and Export fit inside the existing TRACE shell.
- Expanded the case workspace to full available shell width instead of constraining it to the old 1200px center column.
- Wired the Documents tab preview icon to open the Review Suggestions document viewer for the selected file.
- Added an extracted-markdown fallback in the document viewer when native DOCX/XLSX bytes cannot be loaded or rendered.
- Resized Review Suggestions to reserve a 520px decision queue, keep the queue scrollable, and keep reviewer text areas light themed and compact.
- Slimmed Processing and Export sidebars to reduce crowding.

Verification:
- Source guard passed: `node --import tsx .\client\src\document-uplift.redesign.test.ts`.
- Existing Document Uplift source guards passed: item 29, item 30, and severity checks.
- TypeScript passed: `npm run check`.
- API regression passed: `python -m pytest tests/test_document_uplift_api.py -q` passed: 17 passed, existing warnings only.
- Production frontend build passed: `npm run build` passed with existing PostCSS `from` warning and existing large-chunk warning.

Remaining follow-up:
- Recreate both `fastapi_api` and `web_ui_agent` containers so the live app has the preview endpoint and compact shell UI together.

Update:
- Added a detached document preview dialog from the Review Suggestions workspace. The magnifying-glass control in the inline viewer now opens the selected document in a large modal preview.
- Improved Review Suggestions visibility by reducing the embedded document zoom to 75%, narrowing the sections rail, resizing the decision queue to leave more document space, and making the edited-text/reviewer-notes fields collapsible behind `Edit Text`.
- No backend suggestion, SOP processing, or output-engine logic changed in this update.
- Verification passed:
  - `node --import tsx .\client\src\document-uplift.redesign.test.ts`
  - `node --import tsx .\client\src\document-uplift.item29.test.ts`
  - `node --import tsx .\client\src\document-uplift.item30.test.ts`
  - `node --import tsx .\client\src\document-uplift.severity.test.ts`
  - `python -m pytest tests/test_document_uplift_api.py -q` passed: 17 passed, existing warnings only.
  - `npm run check`
  - `npm run build` passed with existing PostCSS `from` warning and existing large-chunk warning.

Update:
- Removed duplicated top-shell `Run Pipeline` and `Generate Outputs` actions from the Document Uplift case page; the actions now live only in the relevant workflow workspaces.
- Removed low-value right-side panels from Documents, Processing, and Export so each tab uses the full TRACE shell workspace width.
- Converted Document Uplift case and landing dialogs (`Document Preview`, `Move To Export`, `Create Case`, `Delete Case`) to the white TRACE modal treatment with light form fields and muted placeholders.
- Updated source guards so Item 29 requires workspace-level actions and rejects the old duplicated top-nav action buttons.
- No backend suggestion, SOP processing, or output-engine logic changed in this update.
- Verification passed:
  - `node --import tsx .\client\src\document-uplift.redesign.test.ts`
  - `node --import tsx .\client\src\document-uplift.item29.test.ts`
  - `node --import tsx .\client\src\document-uplift.item30.test.ts`
  - `node --import tsx .\client\src\document-uplift.severity.test.ts`
  - `node --import tsx .\client\src\package-scripts.test.ts`
  - `node --import tsx .\client\src\sop-uplift.routes.test.ts`
  - `npm run check`
  - `npm run build` passed with existing PostCSS `from` warning and existing large-chunk warning.

## 38. Controls Assurance Frontend Build - 2026-05-13

Built the CT V2 frontend as a separate new feature named Controls Assurance instead of replacing the legacy Control Testing page.

Key changes:
- Preserved the old `/control-testing` page and old `/audit/*` frontend flow.
- Added `/controls-assurance`, `/controls-assurance/new`, and `/controls-assurance/:id`.
- Added the Controls Assurance sidebar entry with a `NEW` badge.
- Added TanStack Query hooks for `/api/ct/*` in `kpmg_ui/client/src/hooks/useControlTesting.ts`.
- Added list, create, and five-tab detail pages for Case Analysis, Population, Evidence, Testing, and Results.
- Added `$imagegen` design board at `docs/superpowers/mockups/controls-assurance/controls-assurance-imagegen-board.png`.

Backend note:
- The legacy backend router `api/routers/control_testing.py` was not modified.
- `api/main.py` registers the new `/ct/*` router for Controls Assurance; legacy `/audit/*` endpoints remain present.

Verification:
- `node --import tsx .\client\src\controls-assurance.test.ts`
- `node --import tsx .\client\src\control-testing.scroll-shell.test.ts`
- `npm run check`
- `npm run build` passed with existing PostCSS `from` and large chunk warnings.
- `docker compose build web_ui_agent`
- `docker compose up -d web_ui_agent`
- `docker compose ps web_ui_agent fastapi_api ct_worker` showed the web/API containers healthy and worker running.
- HTTP smoke returned 200 for `/control-testing`, `/controls-assurance`, and `/api/ct/sessions`.

Next recommended step:
- Run a live Controls Assurance case end to end with the SOX workpaper template and refine UX copy/layout from actual pipeline output.

Update:
- Expanded C&A handling so population and evidence can both carry source/query support files.
- Population upload now stores `population_filename` and `population_file_type`; Stage 3 no longer forces population extraction as Excel.
- Added support-file endpoints:
  - `POST /ct/sessions/{session_id}/controls/{control_id}/population/support-files`
  - `POST /ct/sessions/{session_id}/controls/{control_id}/evidence/{gridfs_id}/support-files`
- Support files store `support_type`, reviewer `comments`, `unique_key_columns`, and `expected_count`, allowing SQL query screenshots, SAP SUIM parameter screenshots, source report PDFs, timestamps, and source-record-count evidence to be considered in C&A.
- Stage 3 now includes extracted primary file content, tabular row counts, unique counts when keys are provided, support-file OCR/text, and reconciliation metadata in both population and evidence C&A prompts.
- Controls Assurance UI now exposes `Source / Query Support` upload panels under Population and each Evidence file, with `Unique Key Columns`, `Expected Count`, and reviewer comments fields.

Verification:
- Red tests first failed for the missing behavior, then passed after implementation.
- `python -m pytest api/tests -q` passed: 88 passed, existing warnings only.
- `node --import tsx .\client\src\controls-assurance.test.ts`
- `node --import tsx .\client\src\control-testing.scroll-shell.test.ts`
- `npm run check`
- `npm run build` passed with existing PostCSS `from` and large chunk warnings.
- `docker compose build fastapi_api ct_worker web_ui_agent`
- `docker compose up -d fastapi_api ct_worker web_ui_agent`
- `docker compose ps fastapi_api ct_worker web_ui_agent` showed API/web healthy and worker running.
- HTTP smoke returned 200 for `/controls-assurance`, `/api/ct/sessions`, and `/ct/sessions`.

Next recommended step:
- Generate a synthetic SQL/SUIM evidence pack and run a live Controls Assurance case to validate count and unique-count reconciliation in LLM C&A output.

Update:
- Fixed the Stage 5 workbook crash found in synthetic scenario `10_workbook_ready`.
- Root cause: an uploaded `.xlsx` evidence workbook was being decoded as text and written directly into the generated workbook Evidence sheet, which produced illegal Excel cell characters.
- Workbook generation now writes a safe attachment summary for binary/non-text evidence files and only previews sanitized text-like evidence.

Verification:
- Added a focused regression test that reproduces the Excel evidence crash.
- `python -m pytest api/tests/test_ct_pipeline_stages4_5.py::test_build_control_workbook_summarises_binary_excel_evidence_without_crashing -q`
- `python -m pytest api/tests/test_ct_pipeline_stages4_5.py -q`
- `python -m pytest api/tests -q` passed: 89 passed, existing warnings only.
- `docker compose build fastapi_api ct_worker`
- `docker compose up -d fastapi_api ct_worker`
- `docker compose ps fastapi_api ct_worker` showed API healthy and CT worker running.

Next recommended step:
- Rerun the workbook-ready synthetic case in the Controls Assurance UI.

Update:
- Stage 5 workbook generation now uses `utils/Testing sheet.xlsx` as the output workpaper template.
- The generated workbook now contains `Test of controls` and `Auditor override`, matching the supplied template.
- Backend testing data is mapped into the form-style workpaper:
  - Workpaper name, period, preparer, and entity.
  - Control ID/title/description/type.
  - Walkthrough and OE testing flags.
  - D&I and OE conclusions.
  - Testing method Y/N selections.
  - Population description/count, selected sample size, and sampling method.
  - Test procedure rows A-I.
  - Sample testing grid, tickmarks, exception notes, and deficiency description.
  - Override log entries in the `Auditor override` sheet.
- The old generated workbook sheet set (`Cover`, `Test Steps`, `Sample Results`, `Exceptions`, `Conclusions`, `Evidence`, `Override Log`) is no longer emitted for Controls Assurance Stage 5.

Verification:
- Added red/green workbook-template tests for the new template cells and override tab.
- `python -m pytest api/tests/test_ct_pipeline_stages4_5.py::test_build_control_workbook_uses_testing_sheet_template_and_visible_cells api/tests/test_ct_pipeline_stages4_5.py::test_build_control_workbook_summarises_binary_excel_evidence_without_crashing api/tests/test_ct_pipeline_stages4_5.py::test_workbook_contains_override_log_tab_when_overrides_exist -q`
- `python -m pytest api/tests/test_ct_pipeline_stages4_5.py -q`
- `python -m pytest api/tests -q` passed: 89 passed, existing warnings only.
- `docker compose build fastapi_api ct_worker`
- `docker compose up -d fastapi_api ct_worker`
- `docker compose ps fastapi_api ct_worker` showed API healthy and CT worker running.
- HTTP smoke returned 200 for `/health` and `/ct/sessions`.

Next recommended step:
- Rerun the workbook-ready synthetic case in the Controls Assurance UI and download the workbook to visually inspect the `Test of controls` sheet.

Update:
- Generated Controls Assurance workbooks now create sample-specific evidence tabs: `Sample 1`, `Sample 2`, etc.
- Each sample sheet records the sample application, item reference, tested step labels, mapped evidence filename/type, and reviewed value.
- Image evidence is embedded directly into the sample tab.
- When Stage 3 saved an `annotation_regions[].bbox`, the embedded image is annotated with a red rectangle around the reviewed area.
- When exact image coordinates are unavailable or the evidence is non-image, the sample tab uses a red-bordered reviewed-value/evidence-preview block instead.
- Stage 5 now downloads evidence support-file blobs as well as primary evidence blobs, so SQL/SUIM/query screenshots attached to evidence can be inserted into the workbook.

Verification:
- Added red/green sample evidence tab test for an embedded image with a red boxed annotation.
- `python -m pytest api/tests/test_ct_pipeline_stages4_5.py::test_build_control_workbook_adds_sample_evidence_tab_with_red_boxed_image -q`
- `python -m pytest api/tests/test_ct_pipeline_stages4_5.py -q` passed: 16 passed.
- `python -m pytest api/tests -q` passed: 90 passed, existing warnings only.
- `docker compose build fastapi_api ct_worker`
- `docker compose up -d fastapi_api ct_worker`
- `docker compose ps fastapi_api ct_worker` showed API healthy and CT worker running.
- HTTP smoke returned 200 for `/health` and `/ct/sessions`.

Next recommended step:
- Rerun the workbook-ready synthetic case and visually inspect the generated `Sample 1` sheet against the example screenshot.

Update:
- Removed `Framework` from the Controls Assurance create-assessment screen.
- The frontend no longer stores, validates, edits, or submits a user-entered case framework from `/controls-assurance/new`.
- The backend now defaults omitted framework metadata to `Controls Assurance`, so API responses remain backward-compatible without exposing the field to users.
- Existing per-control `framework_reference` metadata is unchanged and remains available for template/manual control data if needed.

Verification:
- Added red/green tests to block the Framework field from returning to the create page and to allow frameworkless backend session creation.
- `node --import tsx .\client\src\controls-assurance.test.ts`
- `python -m pytest api/tests/test_ct_models.py::test_create_session_request_defaults_framework_when_omitted -q`
- `python -m pytest api/tests -q` passed: 91 passed, existing warnings only.
- `npm run check`
- `npm run build` passed with existing PostCSS `from` and large-chunk warnings.
- `docker compose build fastapi_api web_ui_agent`
- `docker compose up -d fastapi_api web_ui_agent`
- `docker compose ps fastapi_api web_ui_agent` showed API and web UI healthy.
- HTTP smoke returned 200 for `/controls-assurance/new` and `/health`.
- Frameworkless session create returned default framework `Controls Assurance`; the smoke session was deleted.

Next recommended step:
- Continue reviewing the create-case flow for other fields that should be inferred or moved to a later workflow step.

Update:
- Redesigned the Risk Assessment create experience to match the eye-catching TRACE workspace direction.
- Added a prominent dark command header for create mode with visible workflow tabs: `Create`, `Scope`, `Questionnaire`, `Analyse`, `Risks`, `Controls`, `Residual`, and `Report`.
- Existing assessment sessions now use `Scope` as a distinct tab before questionnaire capture.
- Added richer create metadata fields in the frontend: assessment owner, reviewer, business unit, assessment period, and framework.
- Kept the backend API unchanged; the extra create metadata is appended into the existing assessment description so current create/list/report flows continue to work.
- Added searchable Asset Registry selection with CIA score chips, owner chips, and criticality badges.
- Added a readiness checklist and selected-asset summary to the create screen.
- Fixed the assessment application count so ad hoc applications merged into `asset_ids` are not double-counted.

Verification:
- `npm run check`
- `npm run build` passed with existing PostCSS `from` and large-chunk warnings.
- Captured live UI screenshot: `output/risk-assessment-redesign-create.png`.

Update:
- Re-applied the Risk Assessment workflow redesign to match the provided `risk_ass.PNG` reference more directly.
- Selected-assessment workflow mode now hides the internal sessions rail and uses the full page width.
- Added a compact workflow context header with current assessment, asset, stage, status, risk level, circular progress, and summary.
- Added a horizontal workflow stepper with `Create`, `Assets`, `Questionnaire`, `Risk Review`, `Findings`, `Final Report`, and `Audit Output`.
- Questionnaire now includes an instruction strip, right-side guidance/checklist panel, and cleaner segmented `Yes` / `No` controls.
- Backend flow and submit/analyze/report calls remain unchanged.

Verification:
- `npm run check`

Update:
- Added a shared TRACE top-ribbon universal search before the `Sign Out` button.
- Search matches application page names plus available records from assets, issues, controls, controls documents, regulatory obligations/documents, framework elements/documents, risk assessments, control testing sessions, validation queue items, and uplift cases.
- Matching is tolerant of partial or typo-heavy input such as `asses regisr`.
- Pressing Enter opens the best match; clicking a result opens the relevant module page.

Verification:
- `npm run check`

Update:
- Reworked the Risk Assessment main page to follow the provided `risk_ass.PNG` reference.
- Kept the existing KPMG | TRACE shell and Risk Assessment heading section unchanged.
- Restored `How It Works` as the first main-page section.
- Replaced the prior landing/dashboard surface with a light workflow workspace using context strip, stepper, guidance, checklist, and recent assessment list.
- Restyled the questionnaire view to match the reference layout: top workflow summary, horizontal stepper, instruction strip, accordion question sections, yes/no controls, notes box, and right-side guidance/checklist panel.
- Kept `New Assessment` available and preserved the existing create, submit, analyze, control, residual, and report behavior.

Verification:
- `node --import tsx .\client\src\risk-assessment.overhaul.test.ts`
- `npm run check`

Update:
- Adjusted the shared TRACE top ribbon spacing so the search control and Sign Out button stay inside the page.
- Added right-side padding, constrained the expanding search width, and prevented the Sign Out button from shrinking.

Verification:
- `npm run check -- --pretty false`
- `GET http://localhost:3000/risk-assessment` returned `200`

Update:
- Moved the Risk Assessment page-level CSS block into `RiskAssessmentStyles` under `client/src/styles`.
- The parent now imports the shared stylesheet instead of keeping the large inline `<style>` block, preserving the existing CSS selectors and UI behavior.

Verification:
- `npm run check -- --pretty false`

Update:
- Extracted the Risk Assessment final report workflow page into `RiskAssessmentReport` under `components/workflow`.
- The child component now owns the Cancel, Generate Report, View Report controls and report-ready message while the parent keeps the report preview dialog state.

Verification:
- `npm run check -- --pretty false`

Update:
- Restored Risk Assessment workflow icon navigation to dedicated route paths.
- Workflow buttons now route to page-style URLs such as `/risk-assessment/create` and `/risk-assessment/{assessmentId}/questionnaire` while preserving legacy `?step=` parsing.
- Kept `/risk-assessment/new` as a create-page compatibility alias.

Verification:
- `npm run check -- --pretty false` currently fails because `client/src/pages/RiskAssessment/RiskAssessmentDashboard.tsx` imports deleted `AssessmentProcess.tsx`.

Update:
- Extracted the Risk Assessment workflow rail into `RiskAssessment/components/WorkflowStepper.tsx`.
- Moved the workflow step config, icon button rendering, tooltip summaries, route parsing helpers, and dedicated page navigation into the child component.
- `risk-assessment.tsx` now consumes the workflow child and only handles page state after a workflow page is opened.

Verification:
- `npm run check -- --pretty false` still fails because `client/src/pages/RiskAssessment/RiskAssessmentDashboard.tsx` imports deleted `AssessmentProcess.tsx`.

Update:
- Updated Recent Assessments so opening an assessment navigates to that assessment's dedicated Risk Assessment workspace route before loading it into state.
- Row title clicks and the arrow action now both use the workflow route helper, selecting the best workflow page from the assessment status.

Verification:
- `npm run check -- --pretty false`

Update:
- When a Recent Assessment is opened, the page now starts at the Risk Assessment Workspace panel instead of showing the KPI boxes and How It Works section above it.
- The workspace summary strip now uses selected-assessment-specific summary and risk state, including a `Not assessed` risk label when no risks exist.

Verification:
- `npm run check -- --pretty false`

Update:
- Reused the Risk Assessment Workspace header on selected-assessment pages.
- Hid the `New Assessment` action only for selected-assessment workspace pages while leaving the landing workspace unchanged.
- Removed the workspace summary cell from the context strip and rebalanced the remaining six boxes.

Verification:
- `npm run check -- --pretty false`

Update:
- Added questionnaire completion guards so users cannot move past the Questionnaire workflow step until every question is answered for every scoped application.
- The questionnaire submit action now blocks incomplete current-application answers instead of defaulting unanswered questions to `NA`.
- Workflow stepper navigation now asks the parent page before changing route, allowing incomplete questionnaire navigation to be blocked.

Verification:
- `npm run check -- --pretty false`

Update:
- Added a client-side duplicate assessment title guard to the Risk Assessment create flow.
- New assessments now require a unique title compared case-insensitively against existing Recent Assessments.

Verification:
- `npm run check -- --pretty false`

Update:
- Moved the questionnaire `Save Progress` and `Continue` actions into the Completion Checklist panel.
- Made the checklist panel compact when embedded actions are present to remove unused whitespace on the questionnaire page.

Verification:
- `npm run check -- --pretty false`

Update:
- Redesigned the legacy Control Testing UI surface to match the provided enterprise SaaS reference while preserving the current ControlTestingContext and `/audit/*` flow.
- Added a slow KPMG blue header glow, subtle network particles, sequential workflow fade-ins, flowing connector pulses, and a dark blue upload card with a soft hover glow and non-interactive upload visual.
- Opened the Control Testing `How It Works` flow by default, enlarged the process cards/step nodes, and adjusted the page spacing to 20px side padding with a tight 5px bottom gap.
- Added neutral `HowItWorks` class hooks so page-specific animation styling does not affect other modules.

Verification:
- `node --import tsx .\client\src\control-testing.enterprise-animation.test.ts`
- `node --import tsx .\client\src\control-testing.scroll-shell.test.ts`
- `npm run check`

Update:
- Limited the Risk Assessment create-flow `Applications In Scope` Asset Registry list to one visible application card.
- Added vertical scrolling inside the list when more than one registry application is available.
- Stretched the right-side Submitted Progress column so its bottom edge aligns with the Applications In Scope panel.
- Upgraded the standalone New Assessment page background with a professional animated blueprint treatment: drifting grid, soft mesh lighting, scan sheen, thin data tracks, and subtle signal nodes behind the form panels.
- Restyled the New Assessment `Ad Hoc Applications` panel with a KPMG blue/black glass background while preserving its controls.
- Applied the same KPMG blue/black glass treatment to the `Applications In Scope` panel, including readable registry asset rows and selected states.
- Updated the New Assessment `Assessment Title` and `Description` fields with black glass backgrounds and blue focus states.
- Converted the New Assessment `Assessment Setup` summary box to a KPMG blue-black glass surface.
- Refined the New Assessment `Submitted Progress` circular bar to a thinner ring with white 0% state and greener progress coloring as completion increases.

Verification:
- `node --import tsx .\client\src\risk-assessment.overhaul.test.ts`
- `npm run check`

Update:
- Centralized Risk Assessment child workflow URL parsing and generation in `risk-assessment.tsx`.
- The parent now supports `/risk-assessment/create`, `/risk-assessment/assets`, `/risk-assessment/questionnaire`, `/risk-assessment/risk-review`, `/risk-assessment/findings`, and `/risk-assessment/final-report`.
- Removed direct risk-assessment URL writes from child workflow/list components so the parent owns navigation.

Verification:
- `npm run check`

Update:
- Replaced only the `/landing` hero written copy area with an animated agentic command-center visual.
- Preserved the existing top nav, landing chip, Solutions Overview summary panel, module directory sections, and footer.
- The command text, `Enter Workspace` CTA, and capability nodes remain in the left hero area while the orbit/grid/pulse backdrop now spans the hero background behind the Solutions Overview panel too.
- Repositioned the `Automate` and `Assess` capability cells parallel to the `Your Agentic Control Center` label so they no longer overlap the lower moving cells.
- Made the Solutions Overview panel background transparent so the hero animation remains visible behind it while preserving the panel border and text layout.

Verification:
- `node client/src/pages/landing.layout.test.ts`
- `npm run check`

Update:
- Added shared responsive shell rules for the whole authenticated application.
- On tablet/mobile widths, the fixed left sidebar becomes a compact horizontal top rail and page content takes full width.
- Added global safeguards so common page containers, media, code blocks, and table-heavy content shrink or scroll instead of forcing horizontal overflow.

Verification:
- `node --import tsx .\client\src\components\app-layout.sidebar.test.ts`
- `npm run check`

Update:
- Changed incomplete Risk Assessment workflow connector segments to pure white while completed segments remain green.

Verification:
- `node --import tsx .\client\src\risk-assessment.overhaul.test.ts`

- Cancel returns users to the previous residual review screen.

Verification:
- `node --import tsx .\client\src\risk-assessment.overhaul.test.ts`
- `npm run check`

Update:
- Reverted the standalone existing-assessment route behavior for Risk Assessment.
- `Recent Assessments` rows now open inline on the Risk Assessment landing page again.

Verification:
- `node --import tsx .\client\src\risk-assessment.overhaul.test.ts`
- `npm run check`

Update:
- Existing Risk Assessment rows now open on standalone routed pages at `/risk-assessment/{assessment_id}`.
- Clicking a `Recent Assessments` row navigates away from the landing view and loads the selected assessment workflow on its own page URL.
- Direct browser loads of `/risk-assessment/{assessment_id}` fetch the assessment by id if it is not already in context.

Verification:
- `node --import tsx .\client\src\risk-assessment.overhaul.test.ts`

- `npm run check`

Update:
- Updated the `Recent Assessments` card so only its header uses the KPMG/TRACE navy background.
- Removed the stretched empty row area after short assessment lists by returning the list to natural height with a capped internal scroll for long lists.

Verification:
- `node --import tsx .\client\src\risk-assessment.overhaul.test.ts`
- `npm run check`

Update:
- Reverted the last `Recent Assessments` navy row styling change.
- Restored the light row background, original dividers, text colors, arrow styling, and prior row height.

Verification:
- `node --import tsx .\client\src\risk-assessment.overhaul.test.ts`
- `npm run check`

Update:
- Restyled only the Risk Assessment `Recent Assessments` row area with the KPMG/TRACE navy background.
- Increased row height so short lists feel fuller and remaining space after the last row blends with the row area instead of looking blank.

Verification:
- `node --import tsx .\client\src\risk-assessment.overhaul.test.ts`
- `npm run check`

Update:
- Increased the visual width/weight of each `Recent Assessments` row.
- Rows now use larger horizontal padding, a wider right-side status/action column, and a clearer circular open action for better balance.

Verification:

## 2026-06-22 - Web container port alignment

- Fixed the Express production server default port to `5000`, matching `docker-compose.yml`, the Dockerfile, and the container health check. The previous `3000` default made rebuilt web containers unreachable at `http://localhost:5000`.
- Added a matching `PORT=5000` Compose setting and made authentication requests retry transient upstream failures while preserving the real HTTP/server error message.
- Wired Risk Assessment table `View` actions to the existing assessment workspace. Direct assessment URLs restore the selected session, and the component workflow stepper opens the existing summary, questionnaire, risk review, findings, residual-risk, and final-report components.
- Fixed questionnaire answer labels so `YES`, `NO`, and `NA` render above the button treatment, and corrected the Recent Risk table Actions dropdown positioning/clipping so View/Edit/Delete remain visible.
- Expanded the Risk Assessment dashboard body with no max-width, 16px padding, a consistent 15px outer margin, and a flex-growing recent-assessments table container. Removed its nested viewport-height scroller to prevent trailing blank space; the page now owns scrolling and contains overscroll while the app sidebar remains pinned to the shell height.
- Applied the overflow boundary globally from Dashboard through AI Chat: `html`, `body`, `#root`, and the authenticated shell are locked to the dynamic viewport; page-owned scrollers remain inside the canvas, the sidebar is sticky/full-height, and the footer is a non-scrolling shell row.
- Standardized Dashboard, Regulatory Library, Controls Library, and Asset Registry to centered content viewports using `calc(100% - 30px)`, 15px vertical margins, and automatic horizontal margins while leaving their shared hero headers unchanged.
- Reduced the Controls Library content-to-footer gap to 10px by removing its oversized bottom padding and using a 10px bottom margin.
- Set the Asset Registry content-to-footer gap at the page boundary using exactly 15px bottom padding and zero content bottom margin.

## 2026-06-23 - Dynamic Risk Assessment progress

- Changed the Assessment Details circular progress indicator from wizard-navigation progress to live assessment completion.
- Progress now accounts for scoped applications, saved and unsaved questionnaire answers, identified risks, applied controls/residual results, and the generated report.
- Questionnaire progress advances answer by answer and remains capped between 0% and 100%.
- Made questionnaire Yes/No/NA choices visibly interactive with green, red, and blue selected states respectively.
- Saved questionnaire choices are rehydrated when an assessment is reopened, and each choice exposes its selected state with `aria-pressed`.
- Questionnaire choices also keep immediate component-local selection state so visual feedback is not lost while the parent assessment state rerenders.
- Added authoritative global `aria-pressed` selectors for questionnaire choices so shared white-button theme rules cannot override selected colours.
- Guarded questionnaire Continue until every question for the current application is answered and show a "Please answer all questions" popup when blocked.
- Removed the previous fallback that silently converted unanswered questions to NA.
- Restored visible per-suggestion Apply buttons using self-contained styling and added a Load Control Suggestions action for empty risk-control lists.

## 2026-06-24 - Landing Page Scroll Layout

- Kept the existing agentic hero/summary as the first upper landing section.
- Added a clearly separated current module directory section below the hero so it remains visible while scrolling.
- Preserved the landing page's own scroll container because the global shell locks body/root overflow.

Verification:
- `node client/src/pages/landing.layout.test.ts`
- `npm run check`

## 2026-06-24 - Document Uplift Table Scrollbar

- Added a dedicated vertical scrollbar to the Document Uplift document table row area, capped to two visible rows.
- Kept the document table header fixed above the scrolling uploaded-file list.
- Added a recoverable missing-case state with Back To Cases and Open Current Case actions when an old/deleted Document Uplift case URL is opened.
- Removed the duplicate Document Uplift case-page global header so search/sign-out only render once from AppLayout.

Verification:
- `node client/src/document-uplift.redesign.test.ts`
- `npm run check`

## 2026-06-24 - Risk Assessment Report Button

- Changed the Risk Assessment final report page to show one primary `View Report` action.
- Removed the separate `View Report` button and replaced the old `Generate Report` label on the report page.
- Increased spacing between the report preview `Print PDF` action and the dialog close control.

Verification:
- `npm run check`
- `node client/src/risk-assessment.overhaul.test.ts` currently stops on an unrelated existing `/risk-assessment/new` route assertion before this report check.

## 2026-06-29 - Dashboard Libraries component restructuring

- Replaced the inline Dashboard Libraries tab markup with a `DashboardLibraries` parent component.
- Added one reusable `LibraryKpiCard` child for the Regulations, Controls, Frameworks, and Quality Score metrics.
- Extracted Domain Coverage, Obligations By Domain, Framework Elements By Category, and Assets By Status into individual panel components.
- Kept data fetching, metric calculation, navigation, and quality-analysis behavior in the dashboard page while moving presentation into the Libraries component directory.

Verification:
- `npm run build`
- `npm run check` remains blocked by the existing `tsconfig.json` `ignoreDeprecations` value.

## 2026-06-29 - Dashboard workflow box extraction

- Extracted each top-level Workflows module box into its own named child component: Risk Assessment, Control Testing, Regulatory Testing, Final Reporting, and SOP Uplift.
- Added a presentation-only `WorkflowBoxFrame` shared by the five named children to keep their established visual treatment consistent.
- Extracted each workflow panel into its own named child component: Assessments By Status, Testing Sessions By Status, Control Test Results, SOP Cases By Status, and Reports By Type.
- Added shared workflow panel and segmented-status presentation primitives while preserving the established panel appearance.
- Preserved the existing metrics, navigation destinations, and workflow behavior.

Verification:
- `npm run build`

## 2026-06-29 - Risk Assessment post-create toast fix

- Prevented the route-validation effect from treating a just-created assessment as missing while React is still applying the new assessment-list state.
- The new assessment now remains selected on its asset-scope page without showing the destructive `Assessment not found` toast or redirecting to the base assessment route.
- Removed the destructive `Assessment not found` route-validation toast and redirect so transient post-create lookups remain silent.

Verification:
- `npm run build`

## 2026-06-29 - Regulatory comparison zero-count display

- Fixed comparison KPI cards so valid zero values render as `0` rather than `Data not available`.
- Applied the correction to domains compared, shared domains, and both source gap counts.

Verification:
- `npm run build`

## 2026-06-30 - Risk analysis loader and deployment cache

- Removed the redundant horizontal progress bar from the running risk analysis screen, leaving the spinner as the single loading indicator.
- Added no-cache response headers for production HTML and SPA fallbacks so a VM deployment immediately references the latest Vite asset hashes.
- Kept fingerprinted Vite assets on long-lived immutable caching.

Verification:
- `npm run build`
